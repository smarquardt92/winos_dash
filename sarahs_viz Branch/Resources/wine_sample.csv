26382,"Rich in cherries and spices, this dramatic wine has a linear, structural quality to it, the result of dryness and acidity and minerals. Shows the finesse and femininity often associated with this vineyard. Pretty and polished now, but should develop over the next six years.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
69039,"What a great wine this is. It combines Chardonnay's rich, creamy texture with Sauvignon Blanc's dry, tart, lemony flavors to yield a complex wine that's a joy to drink. The acidic, peppery finish begs for food to accompany it. A very great value.",89,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,15
90800,"A bit too heavy and direct, offering strong, upfront flavors of red and black berries, stone fruits, cola and currants, liberally spiced and oaked. The mouthfeel is full and weighty, lacking some elegance, but it is totally dry. Could be a sleeper.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
97491,"Here's a dry, tannic Syrah whose everyday profile is given extra dimension by its pretty structure. It has interesting flavors of blackberries, currants, bacon and sweet tobacco.",84,US,California,Syrah,12
123881,"Lavish yet not overdone aromas of vanilla, plumeria, dried banana and yellow peach arise from the glass in this blend of 45% Viognier, 45% Marsanne and 10% Roussanne. There is a honeyed character to the palate, along with banana, mango and buttered guava bread, proving quite tropical yet very welcoming.",91,US,California,Rhône-style White Blend,30
50928,"Oak dominates this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. Underneath is a ripe wine, with pineapple and tangerine fruit, brightened with crisp acidity. Made in the popular style and pretty good, but the oak is a little too much.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,28
44854,"This has a squeeze of lime-like acidity that cuts across the broad, rich cherry-pie, red licorice and spicy sandalwood flavors, which come with a touch of funky leather. For all of that fruit, it has a remarkably delicate mouthfeel, and it finishes dry and clean. It's very hard to predict this wine's future, but it's beautiful now to drink after a few hours in the decanter, and it should be fine over the next four years.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,85
121764,"This is warm and tropical on the nose, with banana, papaya, honeysuckle and tuberose aromas proving a bit overpowering. The palate offers smoked apple flavors.",86,US,California,Viognier,30
90351,"Tannic and brooding in its big-boned structure, this high-elevation-grown Syrah will please Cabernet Sauvignon drinkers in its upfront oak and herb overtones. But it remains true to its varietal roots, offering bright Bing cherry, black plum and licorice, complete with loads of earthiness and ground pepper.",88,US,California,Syrah,36
119066,"Common and thin, a rustic wine marked by acidity and green flavors, with the barest suggestion of cherries. Not flawed, just rustic.",82,US,California,Pinot Noir,14
75217,"Bracingly tart, almost to the verge of tasting sour, this blend of grapes from several Dundee Hills vineyards has cool vintage flavors of spiced apple and rhubarb. The acids rule, suggesting that it be paired with fatty fish like salmon.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,40
30099,"A Cinsault-Counoise blend, this is grapey, tasting of just-ripe berries. The flavors turn a little slender on the midpalate, but it's a pleasant quaffer with balanced tannins.",86,US,Washington,Rhône-style Red Blend,36
12249,"The complex nose boasts hints of spring flowers, tobacco, maple syrup and cedar. Now into its second decade, this wine is fully mature, with flavors of molasses and mushrooms that have replaced some of the cherry notes of its youth. The mouthfeel is silky and elegant; the finish chocolaty and smooth. Drink up.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,85
78108,"Twomey has turned to various coastal sources for Pinot Noir for years, with mixed results. Finally, with this Bien Nacido bottling, they've found something worth repeating. It shows that vineyard's balanced structure, with fine acidity and tannins framing cherry, red currant and cola flavors laced with minerality.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,54
136964,"This 50-50 blend from two well-established vineyards is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Young and stiff and still quite tannic, it shows compact cassis and blackberry fruit with an earthy underpinning, a hint of stem that adds some bite to the tannins. As time smoothes it and softens the tannins, more of the concentrated fruit should emerge; it's well-made and balanced; a fine example of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon done in a classic Bordeaux style.",89,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
31010,"Shows pure, pleasurable Chardonnay flavors of white peach, grape, nectarine, honey and vanilla, with no interference from oak. The acidity gives the wine a slight bite. The winemaker did a good job assembling the various lots into this three-appellation blend.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,12
63376,"Heavy, sweet and soft, with syrupy flavors of milk chocolate, blackberries, anise and pepper. Will appeal to those who like this rustic, easy style.",83,US,California,Zinfandel,23
150452,"These grapes were pushed hard: first for ripeness and low yields, then with barrel fermentation and plenty of new wood. The result is a rich, buttery, nutty wine with a core of white-peach flavors that never fully reveal themselves. Drink young before the fruit fades.",85,US,New York,Chardonnay,22
29397,"The fruit is sourced from multiple vineyards across the appellation, including Eastside Estate, a vineyard formerly known as 3 Starrs recently purchased by the producer. Aromas of exotic plumeria provide an inviting entry, followed by a subtle, yet lightly rich expression of yellow apple and ample minerality. Everything combines for a balanced wine that's not overly heavy or overripe.",93,US,California,Chardonnay,39
111563,"With layers of nutty, toasty oak flavors lingering in the background, this is a Sauvignon Blanc with lushness to its core of melon, guava and grass notes.",86,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,15
142064,"A plump, low-acid Chardonnay that boasts modest fruit levels (some peach and pear) alongside nutty, custardy flavors and a toasty finish.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,10
99214,"This proprietary blend brings together many of Napa Valley's old-vine grapes, from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah to Alicante Bouschet and Mourvèdre. Plum sauce, tobacco and leather are seasoned in black pepper and espresso within a full-bodied grippy package.",88,US,California,Red Blend,33
37016,"If the first duty of a wine is to be delicious, this Pinot more than lives up to the obligation. It doesn't show the delicacy or silkiness of a classic Russian River Pinot Noir, being a little heavy and full-bodied. But it's fabulously rich and opulent, offering a tapestry of berry, mocha, spice and smoky oak notes. Soft, smooth tannins and crisp acids add to the pleasure. Drink this over the next few years.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,85
5711,"20% whole-cluster fermented, this rich, brooding blend of Alder Ridge (86%) and Snipes Mountain Grenache brings notes of licorice, dark cherry, black pepper and mortared herbs. It's broad in feel, tart, fruit filled, and tightly wound, needing time in the cellar to unfurl.",91,US,Washington,Grenache,40
44785,"This Bordeaux blend shows an interesting range of fruit flavors and textures from the blend, which includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot. The flavors tend toward red fruits, as in cherries and red currants, while the tannins are quite strong. Shows an immaturity now that strongly suggests 5–6 years in the cellar.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
48645,"A lusty, spicy Zin, born to partner with barbecue. It's powerful, high in alcohol and massive in baked blackberries and cherries, milk chocolate, red licorice, bacon and mounds of black pepper.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,34
67165,"This easy-drinking blend of 33% Cabernet Franc, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Syrah and 17% Merlot opens with blue fruit, herb and spice aromas and leads to sweet, plush fruit and barrel flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide structure.",88,US,Washington,Red Blend,25
8926,"This bottling continues to impress after all these years with its complexity and sheer deliciousness. The '06 shows charred barrel fermentation notes of pungent, smoky wood, but there's a great heart of citrus, melon and pepper spice flavors that makes the wine rich and rewarding. It's made even better by zesty acidity and a bone-dry finish.",91,US,California,Fumé Blanc,20
63532,"A good but rather rustic Cab. Shows fruity flavors of blackberries, black cherries, anise and smoky oak, with a spicy finish. The drawback is the tannic structure, which is jaggedly harsh. Drink now.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
72074,"This is the medium-dry Riesling from this estate vineyard, a notch lower in alcohol than the Dry bottling, and overall a bit rounder. It carries the same excellent texture, length and mix of ripe fruits, with pears and nectarines taking center stage.",92,US,Oregon,Riesling,24
45336,"This is a smooth, rich and very drinkable Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows ripely classic flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and cedar. The tannins are brisk and furry, but the wine doesn't seem like a longterm ager. Good now and through 2014.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,19
127345,"Brawny, with a bite, this wine offers juicy blackberry and black cherry, along with Cab-like elements of clove that give spiciness. Medium bodied and well integrated, it was aged entirely in neutral oak, allowing the fruit to shine.",88,US,California,Malbec,44
32759,"The wine is simple but satisfying, with blackberry and oak flavors. It would be an easy-drinking wine at parties.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,8
4161,"Lavishly, densely ripe and fruity, this big, juicy wine has everything in spades, from the nearly black color to the jammy, dessert-like aromas to the saturated blackberry and black fig flavors to a full, opulent body and richly tannic texture. It sure packs a lot of power into each sip.",92,US,California,Syrah,39
1562,"The Daou brothers' considerable and continual investments is evidence that their wines will matter for years, ensuring a wise investment today. This 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot offers aromas of blueberry and cedar. Once sipped, the tannins grab with strength before dissipating smoothly. It's a seamless combo of spice, fruit, wood and herbs, but will evolve through at least 2025.",92,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,56
105301,"Consistent with previous bottlings, this is dark, oaky, lush with scents and flavors of butter, toast and roasted nuts. The fruit seems secondary to the parade of butterscotch, brown sugar and spice that comes walloping through the palate. The wine turns slightly bitter in the finish. This is a wine for those who love the California style of Chardonnay.",87,US,Washington,Chardonnay,18
113710,"Mellow and subtle, this is a soft-spoken but deeply flavorful special bottling from Navarro. It has great balance, reserved raspberry and black cherry flavors and an appetizing, firmly tannic texture. Save a few bottles until 2020 to see how well it develops.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,55
41477,"Pontin scores with a sweet, lemony, ripe mouthful of fresh and fruity Riesling. Shows the verve and juicy deliciousness of Yakima Valley fruit.",87,US,Washington,Riesling,8
67114,"A rich, balanced and lovely Sauvignon Blanc. Fermented in stainless steel tanks, it's clean and crisp, with vibrant flavors of lemons, limes, vanilla, honeysuckle and spice. Sur lies aging adds a desirable texture of cream.",88,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,16
147909,"The flagship of the Peter Michael Chardonnays is a stylish, sexy wine. Opens with a wonderful nose of peach, tropical fruit, nuts and orange tea; it shows great poise and a classic sense of proportion from bouquet to finish. The wine unfolds and expands in the glass, offering lovely orange, mineral and tarragon flavors. The engaging finish has great length and subtle aromas and flavors. Impressive for its restraint and attention to detail, this is delicious now but will also reward keeping. Cellar Selection.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,85
18187,"Aged four years in oak, this stately wine is adorned with layers of maple sugar, toast and smoked nuts, but its racy sour-cherry flavors shine through brightly. The backbone of this wine is taut with acidity, but bold, richly textured mouthfeel puts the palate at ease. It's sumptuous and revitalizing.",90,US,New York,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
96066,"A little soft and direct, with jammy, pie-filling flavors of pineapples, tangerines, pears and apricots. Drink now.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,48
52192,"This is the kind of wine Franciscan produces so well and reliably. As far as Merlots go, it shows the soft approachability and supple tannins you expect. Flavorwise, it's appealing in ripe red cherries, sweet red licorice and smoky oak. A very nice restaurant wine, and easy to find, with more than 20,000 cases produced.",90,US,California,Merlot,21
98797,"This is the opposite of those gooey, cult-style wines grown down on the valley benches and floor. It's pure mountain in the tannins, acidity and dryness, with below 14% alcohol. It's a food wine, with cassis, cedar and mineral flavors. Should age well for a decade.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
39907,"A very good wine, glamorous in the way of Oakville Cabernets, with beautiful tannins and flavors of blackberries and cassis. But it's also very oaky, with a caramel and wood char sweetness that's a little too dominant. Doesn't seem like an ager.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
18809,"This could be the best Pinot Blanc in Oregon right now, with lushness from barrel fermentation offset by the delicate balance throughout. Despite its modest 12.5% alcohol, this is a wine of considerable depth, with a mix of ripe yellow fruits and persistent, toasty highlights.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Blanc,25
144827,"The Edwards style is big, ripe and rich, and this wine displays it in bold face. Although dry, it's massive in blackberries and cherries, melted milk chocolate, coffee and vanilla flavors. It has the richness of Syrah, without the tannins. This is a silky, complicated and enjoyable wine.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,54
101893,"A lovely Bordeaux-style wine, dry and richly tannic, showing complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, dried herbs and smoky oak, with hints of violets, cocoa and spices. Shows lots of elegant structure, at a good price. Drink now.",88,US,California,Meritage,18
77385,"This is the producer's first vintage from this vineyard—the grapes were previously sold. The site, which sits within Green Valley as well as the Sonoma Coast, is planted to the same clone as sister property Quail Hill, in coveted Goldridge soils. Soft, round and decadent, the wine is full bodied, with bursts of red fruit and crushed stone.",94,US,California,Pinot Noir,65
91216,"Overall, this elegant wine is dry with just a touch of stonefruit sweetness. Lemon yellow in color, there's brightness throughout with ripe apricots, honey and yellow freesia on the nose. A polished minerality and orange pith bitterness help keep things in balance.",86,US,New York,Riesling,16
40317,"A pretty good wine, with blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, and some smoky oak. Nice and dry, with smooth tannins, it's a decent sipper.",84,US,California,Meritage,18
12050,"This tastes like an alcoholic fruit drink with apricot, orange and mango flavors. Still, it's clean and pleasant.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,9
104712,"This is a crisp, minerally wine you could drink as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc. It's rich in citrus, apricot and floral flavors that finish with a honey, fruity flourish. Try with Asian fare.",85,US,California,Verdelho,15
115610,"Nicely dry and very crisp, with mouthwatering acidity that scours the palate and makes it brisk and clean. It's a little too fruity, though, with jammy pineapple, lemon and lime flavors that pall after a few sips.",86,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,26
128189,"Somewhat sharp and tartly aggressive now in jammy fruit, with raspberry, cherry, wintergreen mint and cola flavors, sweetened with smoky wood notes. Doe not seem like an ager, so drink now with very rich meats, oils and cheeses to soften the hardness.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,34
6089,"Sexy and seductive, this melds cherry fruit with a touch of white pepper, blossoming into a full midpalate with length and power. There's a buttery softness, and a dash of caramel, making this ready to go for immediate enjoyment.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,35
73440,"A bit shy on the nose, this appellation-blend bottling shows light cola, red cherry and wet slate aromas. The palate is tightly wound and very earthy, with turned loam, strong wet clay, oregano, sage, pomegranate and hibiscus elements all playing together nicely.",89,US,California,Grenache,35
104474,"Apple cream, squeezed tangerine and a touch of popcorn make for nice, easy and yet layered aromas on the nose of this bottling by the Los Gatos-based single-vineyard-focused winery. Flavors of Gravenstein apples, browned butter and toast pop on the palate, where an intriguing flinty character pushes this into another level.",93,US,California,Chardonnay,48
96444,"A welcome trend in Oregon is making Pinot Noir at moderate alcohol levels—here it's 13.5%. This enhances the wine's details, beginning with the aromas. Cola and clove, licorice and toffee scents promise a tasty bottle that turns out to be bursting with black berries, black cherries, black currant and even black tea flavors.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
8923,"This is a very approachable and tasty wine, especially for a grape that can be so tannic when young. Aromas of cola, chopped mint and cherries translate to a fruity and minty palate, with just enough tannins, a nice acidic spice and a bit of woodiness on the finish. It's very well measured.",92,US,California,Tempranillo,42
43980,"This is tight, tannic and distinguished, yet it shows a sweet, toasted oak touch, with ripe, tart flavors of red cherries, red currants and persimmons, plus accents of red licorice and cola. Beautiful now with decanting, and should glide through the next 10 years.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
71447,"This is a clear step up from the excellent Two Vines Shiraz, and worth the extra couple of bucks. Wild berry flavors and varietal spice are given a somewhat tannic, earthy frame. Flavors suggest graphite, moist soil and some textural, grainy tannins. It's substantial, not just simple and fruity, and offers a lot of depth for the price.",88,US,Washington,Shiraz,11
53185,"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape in the blend is a 14% Cab Franc component. Rich black cherry fruit provides the solid base, but after that the wine tightens down, so decanting would be essential if you plan to drink it soon. The scents weave together black fruits, spices and licorice; more than any of the other new releases from Soos Creek, this needs more time to settle.",92,US,Washington,Red Blend,40
111647,"This Merlot/Cabernet value offering from Meek drinks very well. Fruit is solid and plentiful, a bowl of mixed cherries, stone fruits and plum. Nice chocolaty layering in the finish, which is smooth and creamy. Delicious.",88,US,Washington,Red Blend,13
66431,"This soft wine is minimally oaky and combines quite ripe, figgy, almost honey-like fruit flavors with a vein of butter and almond. Fermented 90% in steel vats and 10% in oak barrels, it has a creamy texture and full body.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,25
79875,"Soft, sweet in jammy raspberry and cherry fruit and caramelized oak, this Syrah is somewhat simple. It's good, but would benefit from greater structure.",85,US,California,Syrah,27
117759,"An awkward wine, high in acid, with grapefruit, green tea and dried thyme aromas and flavors. Okay in its own way, but doesn't seem quite ripe.",83,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,15
92790,"Light aromas of baking spice, vanilla and red fruit lead to well-balanced red-fruit and barrel flavors that taper toward the finish, with coffee flavors lingering.",87,US,Washington,Merlot,15
36473,"The nose of this Gewürztraminer juxtaposes savory earth tones against restrained tangerine and lemon. Subtle hibiscus nectar and citrus flavors lend sweetness the the palate but overall, it's a simple, delicately concentrated wine. The finish is brisk and clean.",85,US,New York,Gewürztraminer,14
92480,"For such a luscious, powerfully built wine, there's a surprising delicacy to this Chardonnay, exhibiting dainty hints of tropical fruit and butter cream on the nose and palate. It is nicely balanced, with bright, lemony acidity and a hint of saline that lingers on the finish.",87,US,New York,Chardonnay,18
118495,"A decent Pinot with lots of upfront fruit, if a bit soft and short on the finish. Shows candied raspberries, cherries and spices.",83,US,California,Pinot Noir,15
4790,"This muted, tannic Cabernet spent 20 months in new French oak. The dark black cherry and berry fruit are overwhelmed somewhat by the toast and oak.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,59
25396,"A blend of Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval vineyards aged in 50% new French oak, this wine brings brooding notes of blackberry bramble, blueberry, mineral, herbs and potpourri. The palate-coating blue-fruit flavors are exceptionally dense, rich and sweet and lead to a hyper-extended finish.",94,US,Washington,Syrah,45
85977,"Rich, ripe and classy, this shows real pedigree in its structure, with brisk acids, firm tannins and a hint of minerals providing the architecture for the cherry and pomegranate flavors. It finishes totally dry and is ready to drink now.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
117722,"A nose of enticing blackberry jam is followed by a slightly smoky, spicy blend of savory, earthy flavors. The nose and palate are a touch discordant, but overall the wine is unique and approachable.",83,US,New Jersey,Merlot,18
67682,"These grapes were pushed hard: first for ripeness and low yields, then with barrel fermentation and plenty of new wood. The result is a rich, buttery, nutty wine with a core of white-peach flavors that never fully reveal themselves. Drink young before the fruit fades.",85,US,New York,Chardonnay,22
26272,"This Pinot Noir is thin and simple, but it does have some pretty spice, raspberry candy and persimmon flavors. Tastes fairly sweet, but crisp acidity provides balance.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
74009,"A blend of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest Merlot, there is a sweet, cinnamon note that punches through, giving accents of spice and candy to the forward red-fruit flavor. This is easy drinking and very tasty—drink up.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,30
39157,"Sweet and brambly, Heron Hill's Ingle Vineyard Cab Franc is fragrant with aromas of cherry pie filling, vanilla spice and dried, ripe wood. The palate is dry and lean, but quite concentrated in fruit with a pleasantly tart raspberry finish.",86,US,New York,Cabernet Franc,18
54859,"All the individual parts of this 100% Cabernet are, in a word, gargantuan. Yet somehow the wine maintains its balance. The fruit is unbelievably ripe and powerful, with black currants, plums and chocolate that veer into a slight, Port-like finish. The tannins are thick and mellow, while oak adds rich notes of caramel. The result is a stupendously lush, delicious and heady wine. Hold for up to 15 years.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,260
91060,"Sweet and candied, with lemon, lime, pineapple, fig and vanilla flavors. Crisp coastal acidity helps provide a savory, cleansing quality.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,11
80521,"This wine is bold and brawny, defined by big, oaky tannin and concentrated weight. Fresh black cherry develops a candied quality in the glass, while an earthy undercurrent of minty forest adds complexity.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
13076,"Smooth and oaky, with a soft and accessible appeal, this is a more limited production offering than the Chateau's regular Columbia Valley Chardonnay. Though undeniably charming, it thins out quickly and does not have the vivid complexity of its sibling.",86,US,Washington,Chardonnay,18
46432,"A real fruit bomb, with explosive flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and peaches, accented with sweet smoky oak. Malolactic fermentation adds softer flavors of buttered popcorn.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,25
78288,This wine shows an almost-black core with a red rim. Jammy blackberry aromas lead to rich and mouth-coating fruit flavors that are ripe. The full body and firm tannins create a thick texture. This rich wine begs for aged cheese or a chocolate dessert for accompaniment. It's made with 50% Syrah and 25% each of Petite Sirah and Zinfandel.,93,US,California,Red Blend,65
111469,"This wine is very fresh at three-plus years. It's lightly structured, with an elegant, silky mouthfeel and flavors of cola, red cherries, peppery spices and oak. Don't be surprised if it shows modest improvement with four or five years in the bottle.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,28
56368,"Here's a good, rugged but dry and fruity Merlot for drinking now. It has pleasant cherry, berry, cola, herb and pepper flavors. Production was 5,000 cases.",86,US,California,Merlot,17
118694,"Minty, with easy wintergreen, cherry and sandalwood flavors framed in stiff tannins. This blend of Dolcetto, Refosco and Nebbiolo needs rich beef dishes.",84,US,California,Red Blend,60
92958,"This cool climate Roussanne shows more of a steely side of the grape, rather than ripe, round and fleshy. Citrus skin and peach pit flavors combine with a slight suggestion of chalk and mineral.",87,US,Washington,Roussanne,24
126135,"This is a pretty, pale purple/rose; bright, peppery and rather delicate. It shows excellent floral aspects, like a good Beaujolais - it's somewhere between Pinot Noir and Gamay, with big fat grapes and heavy clusters that somehow produce a real finesse wine. The acids keep it lively, the peppery notes add a lot of spice and the floral qualities turn the tart cranberry fruit into something special.",88,US,Washington,Cinsault,22
116253,"Cherry colored and lightly bricked, this wine offers aromas of herbs, orange peel, wet stone and cherry. It drinks dry with fleshy, boozy-seeming fruit flavors.",85,US,Washington,Rosé,16
120830,"Leesy silken textures characterize this bold full-bodied Grüner Veltliner. While dry on the palate, notes of roasted pineapple and yielding acidity accentuate its slightly caramelized tone. A touch of canned corn lingers on the finish.",88,US,New York,Grüner Veltliner,15
113865,"Tarry aromas of elderberry, teriyaki beef, soy and purple flowers combine for an umami-driven nose on this bottling from a newer vineyard in the region, with winemaking by Matt Dees. The palate packs vibrantly tart plum juice and dried lavender flavors, held up by powerful acidity, impressive for young vines.",93,US,California,Syrah,60
128605,"Like the label says, this Gewürz is off-dry, with sugary flavors of pineapples, apricots, green apples, papayas and Asian spices. It's uncomplicated and clean.",85,US,California,Gewürztraminer,22
91895,"Closed and muted on the nose at first, this wine shows varietal scents that include blue and red berry fruit and dried sage. Softly textured, it's an approachable middle-of-the-road Syrah.",86,US,California,Syrah,35
106210,"This is an aromatically brooding wine with notes of herbs, pepper and brown spices. It drinks quite sweet with a lightly chalky feel.",86,US,Washington,Syrah,30
31230,"Based on 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, with all four major red Bordeaux varieties represented, this expansive wine is big, dense and dusty in tannins and oak, but offers a soft side, too. Cherry, strawberry and a lift of citrus peel ease the power and intensity, before a chewy, dark chocolate finish. Cellar through 2021.",91,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,100
102531,"This is almost always a rewarding Zinfandel from Bella. The '09 offers flavors of spicy, briary raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, sweet herb and mocha, with a dry, classic finish.",89,US,California,Zinfandel,35
79778,"Lush and generous, this has a center of blackberry fruit, showing barrel accents of sweet baking spices. Notes of graphite and clean earth round out the finish.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
33209,"A tough, dry, tannic wine, with a gritty mouthfeel. The flavors are ripe in black currants, plums, black cherries, sweet oak and earthy, tobacco notes. Seems best consumed over the next three years.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,52
116100,"A bit harsh and overripe, with Porty flavors of baked blackberries, cherries and red currants. Partly, the heat is due to high alcohol.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,55
12292,"This serviceable, affordable wine is dull on the nose yet highlighted with deep black fruit, toasted oak and graphite on the palate. Its rounded texture adds richness.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,23
30451,"Yummy is the word that best describes this wine, but there's much more than just ripe berry flavors. Juicy, fresh and focused, this is akin to drinking liquid raspberries that are drizzled over clean rocks. It is a deep, intense wine that should dazzle you for up to a decade or more.",93,US,Washington,Syrah,50
23386,"A gorgeous wine, dense with flavor. Smooth and plummy, it's loaded with thick streaks of licorice, chocolate, baking spices and coffee liqueur. Long and flowing, it just seduces from the first sip to the last swallow.",92,US,Washington,Syrah,20
97641,"Blackberry and black cherry flavors are right up front, the fruit is definitely the star here. Light suggestions of dried leaf and moist earth add complexity, though in this lighter vintage it does not have the power of previous bottlings. This is a graceful, perfectly balanced wine, whose subtle pleasures will reward those who pay close attention.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
135114,"Soft and syrupy, with tons of oaky spice framing blackberry, cherry, raspberry and chocolate liqueur flavors, this high-alcohol blend of Syrah, Grenache and Petite Sirah tastes sweet and simple.",82,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,35
100895,"A fine Zinfandel, rich and briary, with wild forest flavors of black and blue berries, Asian spices, tangerine zest and smoky sandalwood. Full-bodied and dry, it's nice now and for the next few years.",90,US,California,Zinfandel,18
138953,"Compared to those fat, rich Chards that are hard to pair with food, this one's Chablisian. It's tart in acids and tangy in minerals and stones, with a richly controlled taste that's part apple-citrus fruit and part oak.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,19
129756,"In the blend are smaller percentages of Cab Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. The Red Mountain AVA is noted for thick, tannic wines, with superior aging potential. Here the earthy, peppery red fruits are buttressed with vivid acids and somewhat chewy tannins. The wine was aged two years in 40% new French oak.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,55
72626,"Deep, pungent dark-berry aromas open this round, inviting cherry and raspberry flavored wine. Round and almost overly suave on the palate, it has ample black cherry, chocolate and toast flavors, and closes with a finish sporting dried fruits. The dry, talcum-like tannins allow for early drinking.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
247,"Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.",85,US,California,Merlot,25
129047,"A very good but not great Cask 23, showing plenty of decadence and flair but not perhaps that extra edge of complexity. It's forward now in sweet new oak and flashy, jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries. The tannins are quite an achievement, rich, vibrant and supple. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's full-bodied and dense, with a chocolaty finish. Could gain in the bottle beyond 2012 to about 2018.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,195
58375,"A tremendous wine, this appeals to the senses as well as the intellect. Dry, tart in acidity and somewhat tannic, it shows complex flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, bacon, cinnamon, white pepper and sandalwood. The finish goes on and on. So delicious now, you can hardly keep from drinking it, but this is a Pinot Noir that will age for 6–8 years, gradually losing primary fruit and gaining interesting mushroom and dried fruit notes.",95,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
37622,"Juicy cranberry and pie cherry fruit brings this wine into clear focus. There is an underpinning of wet cement that comes across in the mid-palate, a sort of a stone wall that the fruit can't quite overcome. It fades into an astringent, tannic finish, still buoyed by those juicy acids.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
88822,"Very golden and even nearing brown in color, this wine by the Paso Rhône pioneer shows walnut oil, honey and dried lemon peel on the nose. It's not so dense on the palate, offering an essence of brown pear and orange rinds. It could use a touch more mellowing in the bottle.",88,US,California,Roussanne,35
96276,"Sourced from an experimental vineyard planted in the early 1970s, this blends eight different varieties, all picked on the same day and co-fermented. At least one red grape (Cabernet Sauvignon), adds a touch of amber to the wine. It could be called rosé, though it's listed as a white wine. In any event, it's unique, with concentrated flavors of tree fruits, citrus peel and anise. Try it with charcuterie.",89,US,Oregon,White Blend,28
54211,"A rich, thick, heavy Merlot, a little too soft and melted in structure, but so delicious, it's easy to like. Shows flashy black cherry jam, chocolate, roasted almond and caramel flavors, rather like a granola candy bar.",86,US,California,Merlot,26
50036,"As tasty as a pear tart, this combines mild pear, vanilla and almond flavors on a smooth texture. Medium bodied, balanced slightly to the soft side, and quite fruity, it will make a satisfying glass at cocktail time or with dinner.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,10
94733,"This seriously good Zin shows off its ancient vineyard's terroir as well as Dry Creek's amenability for Zinfandel. Rich and complex, the wine is very spicy, flooding the mouth with creamy flavors of grilled red cherries, red currants, Fig Newton cookies, mocha and even a hint of sweet, char-broiled beefsteak. Now through 2012.",91,US,California,Zinfandel,30
69232,"Similar in every respect to the '09 vintage, a softly ripe wine that's drinkable now despite Petite Sirah's firm tannins. It's very delicious, showing candied blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate.",89,US,California,Petite Sirah,26
118155,"Extremely pale in color and dilute in flavor, this might be reminiscent of watermelon, and could go down easily on a warm day. But there's not much here in the way of actual flavor.",83,US,Oregon,Rosé,18
117140,"Sourced from Red Willow, Olsen and Les Collines, this is the finest effort yet from Gramercy Cellars and one of the greatest Syrahs ever produced in Washington state. Think Hermitage with brighter fruit. It's intensely aromatic, dense and seamless, stacked with rich flavors of mixed berries, layers of smoke, earth and herb, and punctuated by citrusy acidity. Highlights of oranges and tangerines sneak into the finish, which lingers for an astonishingly long time. Exceptional in every way.",98,US,Washington,Syrah,55
120781,"A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec, this is supple and substantial, and it breathes lush notes of plum, cassis, black olive, raw wood and mineral, plus a dash of caramel.",91,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,30
57541,"With aromas like wood smoke, cardamom and black pepper, this is a beefy, spicy wine. It is full bodied, quite oaky in flavor, and almost tastes like pepper steak in liquid form. Ripe and satisfying dark-fruit flavors kick in and linger on the finish.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,22
100909,"There are massive flavors in this wine, and they're delicious. It just floods the mouth with milk chocolate, raspberry cream and cherry pie-filling flavors. The wine is pretty high in alcohol, but it's a classically rich, ripe Sonoma Zin.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,42
143340,"A little harsh and tannic on opening, with a touch of overripeness, but softens as it breathes. Ultimately satisfies for its white pepper and smoky oak-infused cassis, cherry and leather flavors that finish dry and clean. Could develop in the next 2 years.",87,US,California,Syrah,18
65234,"Soft, lush and ripe, this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend has extracted black currant, blackberry jam, mocha and oak flavors, with a hint of maple syrup. It's ready to drink now.",87,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,67
70144,"Baked plum, underripe raspberry and cola aromas meet with roasted meats, strong fennel, composting flowers and pencil shavings on the complex nose of this appellation blend. The palate is just as hearty, with thyme, anise, marjoram and Indian spice giving depth to the rounded cranberry base. Bitter orange rind and tangy green-olive touches push it even deeper.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,38
133702,"Here's Fife's basic Southern Rhône blend. It's a clean, interesting and basically delicious wine, rich in red and black stone fruit flavors that have a chocolaty edge. The more you sip it, the more you like it.",87,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,12
37857,"A blend of 81% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. An unusually tight Pedestal, this absolutely must be decanted. It opens well, with black fruits, toasted grain, and firm tannins, then hits a wall and stops short. However, with a lot of breathing time and/or aerating, it broadens out a bit and shows more length and finesse.",91,US,Washington,Merlot,55
108967,"Tribute is a blend of 43% Barbera, 43% Sangiovese and 14% Nebbiolo—a difficult enterprise at best, particularly with fruit from young vines. It's thin and generic, showing no distinct varietal character.",85,US,Oregon,Red Blend,35
47470,"Quite a nice Cabernet Sauvignon from this veteran producer, but be warned. It's very tannic. There's a hard astringency that locks it down, but underneath that is beautifully ripened blackberry and cherry fruit. Will it age? Probably not for more than 4–6 years, when the tannins will still be there.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
125365,"Dried herb and sage provide aromatic complexity before this full, generously styled wine takes on deeper, richer flavors of boysenberry, graphite and cedar. Soft oak and tannin provide approachability amid moderate structure.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,85
98331,"This is all about buttered toast, buttered popcorn and orange- and pineapple-soda flavors. Fans of the popular style will love it.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,28
94867,"Nice and dry, with pleasant flavors of cherries, raspberries, mocha and sandalwood. A good wine to drink now with pork, ham, or a mushroom-olive tapenade on bruschetta.",86,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,50
125533,"This bottling is Alsatian in style and almost reductive, with pink grapefruit pith, bitter orange, rounded peach and quinine touches. It's tightly wound on the palate, with high-toned petrol flavors accenting its crisp stone fruit core",88,US,California,Pinot Gris,19
10063,"This Syrah-based blend of five different red grapes may be “big” in blending components, but it's quite sleek and elegant on the palate. It's not a deeply concentrated brooding wine, but brisk and spry, offering fresh black-cherry and berry flavors. Soft feathery tannins and notes of cedar and forest floor linger on the finish.",88,US,New York,Red Blend,25
79505,"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,18
45308,"This wine combines fruit from several notable vineyards, including Goldrock Ridge, Thale's Estate and Wildcat Mountain. Together, they drive a focused expression of smoky dark fruit and tart, moderate acidity. The fruit shows a depth of ripeness that's intense, with a finish of spicy black tea.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,34
15900,"A deep color, ripe fruit flavors and a richly tannic texture make this full-bodied wine mouth-filling and satisfying without being heavy. A nice, moderate, spicy oak layer under the blackberries and a hint of pepper add welcome complexity.",88,US,California,Grenache,25
58098,"Here's a vibrantly fruity, fresh young wine. It's light in texture and silky, with crisp, lip-smacking flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, cola, clove and cinnamon. Delicious now.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,28
123349,"New oak gives a vanilla cream and buttered toast accent to this pretty wine, but the basic fruit flavors also are nice, offering varietal waves of pineapples, pears and green apples. It's a super-drinkable Chardonnay whose richness suggests elaborate fare, like shellfish.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,30
95579,"This wine has an elegant edge, with its hints of tea, spice and mint on the nose and its pleasant, harmonious plum and red berry flavors on the palate. Easy to drink and food-pairing friendly.",84,US,New Mexico,Meritage,23
34527,"Brambly cherry fruit carries a generous amount of vanilla and clove highlights, along with a lightly smoky aroma of Earl Grey tea. Such details bring the wine to a deliciously satisfying finish.",94,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,150
126490,"A sound wine for everyday drinking, this has firm tannins and blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, plus a touch of spicy licorice on the finish.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
84836,"Held back for four years, this Pinot still is a little gritty, with some sharp edges. The cherry, cola, oak and bacon flavors have a barnyardy funkiness. Ready now.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,38
32006,"100% Malbec, it's redolent with dark plums, wild blueberries and peppery spices. The soft, silky flavors are light but have good concentration with the oak (80% American) seeming quite dialed back.",87,US,Washington,Malbec,20
39470,"A trail of smoke wafts from start to finish on this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay from Fox Run. Refreshing and lean on the palate with an abundance of fresh apple flavors, it's bright and clean with a lemony acidity that shines.",85,US,New York,Chardonnay,13
97999,"With a single sip, this   may seem indisputably feminine with its exquisite white floral nose and soft, pink grapefruit palate. But a second or third sip reveals a surprisingly sleek complexity—hints of pine and lime zest on the palate, racy acidity and a long finish marked by a steely, dark minerality.",89,US,New York,Riesling,20
56922,"Dry, juicy, ripe and balanced, Gainey's best Merlot since 2005. As they've begun sourcing grapes from farther inland, the wine has grown richer. Shows a nice integration of oak with flavors of currants and red licorice, with a distinguished finish. Now–2013.",90,US,California,Merlot,38
42006,"Whiffs of juicy melon and yellow peach brighten darker notes of potpourri and aged honey on this very pleasant late-harvest Riesling. Quite hefty on the palate with hints of dusty minerals and a sharp, clean acidity.",87,US,New York,Riesling,22
11097,"Here's a rich, full-bodied wine that rolls from the first floral sniff into a wellspring of deep, briary, berry-cherry fruit. Peppery spices and dried Mediterranean herbs meld on an endlessly fascinating finish that promises decades of development ahead.",94,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,56
139857,"Super-oaky, with what smells and tastes like heavy char that gives it a burnt, ashy note, although there are some decent peach flavors.",82,US,California,Chardonnay,9
146838,"This wine is quite dry, with a good grip of dusty tannins and a silky mouthfeel. It has cherry-berry and cocoa flavors and a long, fruity finish. Drinking well now, it should be consumed in the next year to preserve vibrancy.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,25
7466,"This offers bright raspberry jam, herb, pepper and spice aromas. It's full of vanilla flavors, seeming somewhat disjointed.",86,US,Washington,Red Blend,25
23876,"Thea's Selection is Lemelson's “measuring stick” Pinot Noir, as it is a blend of blocks from the different estate vineyards. This elegant release emphasizes aromas of pungent herbs, lifted with hints of rose petal and briary berry. In the mouth there is a lively, sappy, fruit-centric focus, showing concentrated raspberry (framboise) flavors. In short, a thoroughly delicious bottle that makes the case for blends over most single-vineyard offerings in Oregon.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,38
42698,"Simple, sweet and direct, with honeyed flavors of raspberries, crunchy vanilla granola, vanilla pastry and cocoa. Make it drier, and it would score higher.",83,US,California,Merlot,18
67305,"Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,28
87764,"The art is in the blend here—a commingling of vintages and vineyards. The wine is fruity, fleshy and briary, with a spicy cardamom note on the midpalate and a finely honed texture.",89,US,California,Zinfandel,18
113,"Savory apples and pears mingle into lemon and bramble in this slightly earthy off-dry Riesling. Sunny tangerine acidity is easy but bright, leading a delicately sweet finish.",86,US,New York,Riesling,25
34677,"Coming in at 47g/L residual sugar, this is quite ripe and aromatic with notes of peach and flowers but doesn't have the acid to hold it together.",85,US,Washington,Riesling,13
11597,"This wine, from a label named after one of the state's wine pioneers, is Chardonnay in the traditional California style—done exceedingly well. Aromas of caramelized apples and butterscotch lead into a palate full of apple flesh, vanilla custard and sea salt, yet with enough pithy acidity to keep the mouth watering.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,40
113081,"Blackberry and raspberry flavors are ripe and juicy yet invigoratingly crisp in this elegant Bordeaux-style blend. Subdued spice and perfumed violet notes enhance bold berry flavors on the midpalate. A well-integrated package with finely textured tannins, it's ready to drink now but should improve through 2025.",92,US,New York,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,35
148344,"One of the nicest California Pinot Grigios we've tasted. Pleasing, lively green apple, citrus, almond and herb notes play from aromatic start to bright, lingering finish. The flavors tend more to the Italian renditions of this grape, yet the fruit expression is all Sonoma. Editors' Choice.",88,US,California,Pinot Gris,16
82883,"Is this the first Chardonnay-Albariño blend in California? Maybe, and based on the wine, there should be more. Shows Chardonnay's cool-climate tangerine and green apple fruit, while the Albariño adds zesty acidity and a white flower, lemon tang. A brilliant wine to drink now.",92,US,California,Chardonnay-Albariño,28
87381,"A salty, briny, minerally quality is pronounced in this larger-scale wine that opens intensely sour before mellowing into green apple and quince notes. Medium in weight, body and impact, it finishes with a tartness that suggests the need for food.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,18
66144,"The valley is today's modern Silicon Valley, but used to be one of the most famous placenames in California wine. This Syrah is dry and classy, with a Côtes-du-Rhône berried deliciousness and a soft, immediate appeal.",88,US,California,Syrah,27
79021,"Shows all the hallmarks of the modern style of Chardonnay, with lots of ripe citrus and oak. The wine has too much oak, though, and is dominated by caramelized wood and sweet vanilla flavors that swamp the fruit.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,35
97038,"While not as blossomy in perfume as previous vintages, there's plenty of fresh watermelon and sour-cherry refreshment here. Exceptionally light bodied and dry, it's an invigoratingly crisp summer sip. The finish is brisk but crystalline and mineral.",88,US,New York,Rosé,18
73098,"In 2004 new winemaker William Ammons began at Glen Fiona, and this is the first of his wines to be released. This is spicy with pepper and herb, both in the nose and in the mouth. The fruit is quite tart and tastes of rhubarb and cranberry.",86,US,Washington,Syrah,30
40488,"The fruit for this wine comes nearly equally from Red Mountain and Horse Heaven Hills (Alder Ridge, Force Majeure and Heart of the Hill vineyards). Jammy raspberry and plum aromas lead to rich, full flavors. It brings plenty of fruit-filled appeal, though the variety's wild side seems tamed.",91,US,Washington,Mourvèdre,30
33382,"Rich, ripe scents of cherry pie and cherry cola waft from this profoundly aromatic Merlot. It's boldly alcoholic and full bodied, but the palate shows restraint with crisp red berry flavors highlighted by a streak of acidity. Soft, furry tannins coat the finish.",86,US,New York,Merlot,18
90980,"A pretty good Cab, but maybe a little pricey, with candy sweet blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors and lots of caramelized, vanilla-scented oak. The tannins are a little tough and there's a minty streak.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
117681,"Immature now, with sweet, jammy blackberry, cassis and charred oak flavors, wrapped into firm, hard tannins. Tastes almost rustic, but there's pedigree in there. Give it a few years and see what happens.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,55
55890,"A bit more than half Merlot, this Bordeaux-style blend is balanced and complex. Layers of flower, fruit and earth unfold gracefully. There are suggestions of clean mushroom as well, with a smooth, seamless mouthfeel and modest length.",89,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,42
72872,"A bright, lovely layering of cherry and strawberry strikes first, before a jolt of rose perfume finds its complement in an earthy lilt of salt and forest. Sandalwood enhances the intrigue and complexity of this medium-bodied wine.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
144333,"On the nose, apple and Concord grape aromas take on a stewed quality; add cream and graham cracker to the mix, and you've got a pretty sweet opening. Mouthfeel is soft and even, but perhaps hollow; palate and finish shows blackberry fruit, cocoa and toasted oak",83,US,California,Syrah,9
121110,"Very lush and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and cassis flavors, with an oaky overlay, and there's a minerality toward the end that smacks of the soil. With an acidic jamminess and fierce tannins, the wine feels austere and remote. Give it 6 or 7 years in the cellar to come around.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
30581,"Tart and sharply-defined, this single-vineyard effort offers edgy flavors of melon, apple, pineapple and jicama. The vineyard's signature minerality is evident as well.",88,US,Washington,Roussanne,23
148978,"There is an appealing, loose-knit openness to this wine, which is labeled Cabernet Sauvignon but includes 15% Merlot and some Cabernet Franc and Lemberger as well. Lemberger, you say!? Well, it adds a touch of grapey insouciance to the wine, which is fruity, forward, nicely balanced and easy to enjoy.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,16
34118,"Featuring the Wädenswil clone, this block selection carries a whiff of wintergreen and lavender. That minty lift elevates the palate's pretty cherry fruit. It's a harmonious wine, with perfectly proportioned acids and a faint truffle note as it fades gracefully.",93,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,60
3880,"Tropical with notes of gingerbread and vanilla, this wine tastes full bodied despite its medium level of alcohol. It offers a reduced note on the finish, anchored otherwise in sweet toffee.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,35
65104,"Kind of full-bodied and heavy for a Pinot, with flavors of baked cherry pie, rum-soaked currants and French roast coffee. The tannins are fairly forward and stiff too. This is a young wine, and it may throw a little sediment and lighten up with a year or so in the bottle.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
21375,"This is a very flamboyant Chardonnay. The grapes are superripe in pie-filling pineapples, nectarines and oranges, enhanced with smoky oak and sweet buttered popcorn, but the finish is completely dry. Drink now with rich fare, like lobster and shellfish.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,25
16230,"Roughly 140,000 cases were produced, making this (along with the Two Vines) the benchmark budget Merlot for the state, if not the country. These wines are given plenty of cellaring, which helps to soften them up. The style is wide open and flavorful, with broad cherry and berry fruit set against very smooth, chocolatey tannins. The Grand Estates has thicker, more substantial weight and a silky, milk chocolatey finish.",88,US,Washington,Merlot,11
11571,"A 100% varietal wine, this is dry and in balance, made in a bigger fuller style that presents as lush and plush on the palate. Apricot and peach offer a ripe succulence of fruit as a touch of oak integrates well into the background.",91,US,California,Viognier,32
12204,"From a section of the vineyard planted to only one clone, Paige's is luscious and velvety, smoothly decadent in sanguine, tangy fruit. Full bodied and in balance, it suggests a wild note of mint or bay leaf, something savory as one would find in a cassoulet or beef stew, two things with which it would pair well.",94,US,California,Pinot Noir,115
28063,"Raspberry and vanilla introduce this wine, made from a selection of vines 21 to 130 years old, with some planted in 1882. Lusty and lush layers of cinnamon and cola accent the fruit and provide complexity, the tannins resolved and thick.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,45
67356,"Zesty lemon peel and blossom notes are invigorating and fresh on this dry, delicately framed wine. It's concentrated with tropical mango and melon flavors, yet zippy with lime acidity. It finishes long with an elegant mineral touch.",89,US,New York,Riesling,15
122755,"This nonvintage, Bordeaux-style blend is predominately grapes from the 2012 harvest, with a small addition of 2011 to add balance. The nose is spice-driven, with tart currant and green peppercorn pervading. The palate shows a bit more ripeness, offering tart plum and blackberry up front, but leads to a slightly green and astringent finish.",85,US,Virginia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,20
58385,"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc and Sémillon, it tastes like green apples sprinkled with herbs and white pepper, on a smooth texture with fairly full body. An appealing intensity lingers on the finish.",85,US,California,White Blend,15
83067,"American oak is the barrel choice, 100% new, and it shows strongly in the nose of this young Zinfandel. The citrusy acids help to balance out the alcohol, and with additional bottle age the score could certainly rise. If you plan to drink this soon, give it plenty of breathing time.",88,US,Washington,Zinfandel,25
132254,"This is very appealing for the soft, sexy texture and drink-me-now black currant flavors, but it's lacking the acid-tannin structure that great Napa Cab needs. Drink now and for a few years.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
38087,"This wine shows the hand of the winemaker in the buttered toast, vanilla, crème brulée, honey and creamy lees that dominate the palate. The underlying fruit is a little thin, suggesting tangerines and papayas. The price-quality ratio is fair.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,35
93599,"Released at one year of age, this single-vineyard Zinfandel is too young for enjoyment. It shows hard tannins and tart, candied fruit flavors that have yet to emerge into bottle complexity. Give it until late 2010, and it should provide plenty of berry, cherry and spice enjoyment for a few more years.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,30
69468,"Enormously aromatic and very sweet, this rich, thick dessert wine has good acidity, and it needs it to balance out the honey, apricot purée, lemon custard, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. A refreshing and delicious wine.",91,US,California,Gewürztraminer,20
19102,"This vineyard, and the AVA it occupies, is often characterized by some sharp metallic mineral-driven flavors. Here it seems just marginally ripe, with beet, black tea and metal dominating the astringent finish.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,55
23197,"A little rustic, with a briary, brambly mouthfeel, but it's a good example of a Sonoma County Zinfandel. The winery says the vines are old, and there are deep, concentrated flavors of wild forest berries, shriveled raisins, licorice, pine tar, grilled beef and black peppers. Because of the roughness, you'll want to give this wine a few hours of decanting.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,38
120834,"Good for Cinnabar for holding this Cab back a while, to let it develop in the bottle. Although it's still pretty tannic, it has entered its drinkability window. Dry and full-bodied, it shows classic flavors of black currants and smoky cedar, with a long, impressive finish.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
146711,"A bouquet of dark red fruits and heavy cedar accents opens this even, well-balanced offering. Looks and tastes mature; the dry, cherry-chocolate flavors are forward, and it closes with handsome tobacco and cedar notes. Appealing and ready to go. Drink now to 2004.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
27402,"The blend is Syrah, Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon. The alcohol is very high, to the tune of 16% by volume. And the flavors are like Port, with incredibly rich chocolate and spicy red currants. This is a barbecue wine if ever there was one.",86,US,California,Red Blend,45
82521,"For maximum enjoyment, drink this almost all-Merlot blend now. It shows ripe, lush black-cherry, red currant, plum and bacon flavors that finish spicy and sweet tasting. The tannins are thick but smooth.",90,US,California,Merlot-Cabernet Franc,48
93108,"Leather pouch and earthy cedar and forest floor make for an intriguing wine, powerful in big, dry tannins, especially on the finish. The strength of the wine, and the balance of citrus-like acidity, suggest cellaring, through 2020.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,80
27600,"Opening with gorgeous aromas of pear, fig and mineral-laden melon and vanilla, this substantial Viognier also manages to stay fresh, vibrant and fruity, a bite of preserved lemon lifting off the finish.",91,US,California,Viognier,45
88132,"A surefire success in all the Milbrandt vineyard holdings, Syrah shows stuffing and spine here. It's firm, herbal and earthy, with a lightly funky aspect. But the fruit is there in support—black cherries and blackberries—and the hint of toast and mocha in the finish provides exactly the right send-off into the next sip.",90,US,Washington,Syrah,25
141633,"Good effort in the dark, syrupy vein of Washington Syrah. The scents are ripe and somewhat raisiny, almost Port-like, but the oak has been reined in and the wine reflects the character of the vintage, which was quite warm. The flavors are dense with mincemeat pie, rum raisin, prune, soy and chocolate, a veritable baker's box of spices. Notes of cherry tobacco lead into dry, herbal tannins; hot and assertive, yet packed with flavor.",89,US,Washington,Syrah,28
93145,"Made from a 50-50 combination of old vine Gamay and Charbono, both grown in Calistoga, this wine opens in a nondescript way and offers a thick texture of tannin and density, becoming shyly fruity in the glass, a mix of cherry and strawberry.",86,US,California,Rosé,25
38665,"This is 100% varietal with all of the fruit coming from 1989 plantings. Bittersweet chocolate, green herb and barrel aromas are followed by cherry flavors with a chalky feel.",89,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
92433,"Something went south on this wine. It smells and tastes burnt, like it went through a fire, and the simple flavors are like the syrup in canned peaches.",81,US,California,Chardonnay,12
135218,"Soft and awkward, with dull berry flavors that have a vegetal tinge.",80,US,California,Syrah,18
124774,"A Bordeaux blend with a little Syrah, this red wine is dry and rich in currant and cedar flavors. But it's a little sharp and green in tannins, with a tart mouthfeel. A good steak will help, but it's not really an ager, so drink up.",86,US,California,Red Blend,36
79949,"This largely tannic wine clearly needs time to open in the glass or on the table. It initially shows herbal elements around a core of clove and black cherry. Well-made, it's structured and a good match for meals.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
38128,"Classic, elegant Pinot Noir aromas introduce this delightful wine. Whiffs of flowers, citrus and fresh herbs accompany a tart, pretty palate with nuanced rhubarb, cranberry and raspberry flavors.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,38
112422,"Ballentine continues to struggle with this bottling. It's more balanced than the '02, but still has a harsh, baked quality to the cherry-berry fruit. That accentuates the tannins, which feel hard and astringent.",83,US,California,Merlot,22
145267,"Here's a nice glass of Cab, rich and dry and ripe. It has forward flavors of jammy blackberries, black cherries and cassis, with very rich, thick, complex tannins, but it's so sweet in fruit and so velvety, it's instantly drinkable.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
678,"Light, bright and refreshing, it offers pear spritzer, lime zest and a hint of guava on the nose, followed by citrus rind, light papaya and apple juice on the palate. It makes a nice bridge between the richness of Chardonnay and crispness of Sauvignon Blanc.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,18
26765,"This new brand is sourced from various vineyards throughout the valley. It's very ripe and interesting, offering the rich flavors and balance of the vintage. Gentle now in blackberries, black currants, anise and sweet cedar wood, and should develop over the next 5–6 years.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,52
56671,"This crisp and stylish Chardonnay could serve as a poster child for Washington, with its emphasis on the fruit, not the barrel, and modest ripeness that accents green apple and gooseberry flavors, with a little brioche in the finish. Scented with apple blossoms and lemon oil, this style brings out the intensity of the fruit, and enhances the capacity of the wine to cleanse your palate, leaving you refreshed and ready for food.",88,US,Washington,Chardonnay,20
106824,"This wine grabs the attention with a distinctive earthy, wild yet sophisticated personality. The aroma is like forest floor, dried mushrooms and black tea. Flavors convey rhubarb and plum but also are savory and smoky as they fill the mouth and linger on the finish.",94,US,California,Pinot Noir,44
31516,"This 100% varietal wine, fermented and aged in stainless steel, is silky and creamy, with a medium body and texture that retains a sizzle of freshness on the palate. Well balanced, it offers melon, green apple and lemon, with a tease of fresh-cut peach, ending crisp and clean.",91,US,California,Albariño,20
97576,This relatively light wine smells and tastes like strawberries and raspberries. It has good balance and a straightforward texture.,86,US,California,Zinfandel,16
132362,"Tastes of new oak and is also acidic, a combo that makes the mouthfeel rather harsh and salty, despite obviously well-ripened fruit. May settle down and show softer, lusher notes in a year or so.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,38
831,"Allowing Zinfandel to take the 60% lead in this marriage with Cabernet Sauvignon, this is an impressive mingling of the two. Black pepper, clove and leathery cigar fuel a high-powered succulence of black and red fruit accented by a smoky drawl.",90,US,California,Red Blend,80
78446,"Well made in a lighter style, this offers strawberry and raspberry fruit, tart acids, and a tight, somewhat tannic exit. This winery has dramatically reduced the alcohol levels of their wines over the past few years—by what means we do not know—but the 13.1% listed here feels a little thin.",86,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,60
28337,"The raspberry, cherry and dried cranberry flavors of this soft, silky wine are marred by excessive sharpness and acidity on the finish.",82,US,California,Red Blend,19
106051,"Expressive, not expensive, this has an appetizing mixture of spice, herb and smoke aromas, plenty of blackberry and raspberry flavors, and a soothing texture. It smells like black pepper, dried thyme and wood smoke, then turns more fruity in the mouth. It is medium bodied and slightly soft in balance.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,10
28825,"Delicate notes of bramble and stem waft from nose to finish on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. Tart lemon and crunchy pear keep the palate quaffable and crisp.",85,US,New York,Riesling,14
125972,"This is a rare single vineyard, 100% varietal bottling of Cinsault from the state. Aged 18 months in neutral oak, the focus is on freshness and purity and it brings plenty of both. Vibrant aromas of violets, potpourri, red fruit, orange peel and plum are followed by mesmerizingly pure fruit and savory flavors that linger on a long finish. A light oxidative note provides a touch of distraction.",90,US,Washington,Cinsault,21
92662,"A peanut- and butter candy-like aroma leads to a buttery, salty flavor and a texture rich enough to leave an almost-sweet glaze on the palate. The is an extreme style of Chardonnay that emphasizes concentration and richness in an unusual but delicious way.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,22
141612,"Flawed. Smells and tastes dirty and funky, with medicinal cherry flavors.",82,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
87402,"This bright, fresh and fruity wine presents an appealing mix of apricot and peach aromas, ripe and round peach flavors and a smooth texture. Rather full bodied, it is lifted by a good amount of tangy acidity.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,25
4349,"Bright, compressed fruit stars in this approachable and affordable Pinot Noir that's rounded with tannin and focused acidity. Cranberry, orange, cherry and cola flavors highlight its medium-bodied power and concentration.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
77172,"This Zin specialist shows she knows her way around this hearty variety as well, creating a wine that's expressive in voluptuous notions of chocolate and blackberry pie. Soft and smoky, it shows ripeness balanced by underlying acidity and a wisp of black licorice as it goes down.",90,US,California,Petite Sirah,40
106977,"Shea, as always, is a full-bodied, fruit-driven Pinot with a broad midpalate showing blackberry fruit and citrusy acids. It falls away rather quickly, leaving a stony impression, but is missing the concentration of Shea bottlings from other vintners.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
102542,"This is a sweet, raw blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Cinsault. Not going anywhere.",80,US,California,Red Blend,23
135565,"This Pinot Noir, named for a particular soil type in the Willamette valley, is scented strongly of the lumber smell you get at a building supplies store. There is a simple but pleasing layer of strawberry/raspberry fruit hidden in the wine's core. Perhaps a year or two of bottle age will pull things together.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,30
107966,"Rustic and likeable, an easy wine to wash down burgers or simple Italian. Has loads of cherries, blueberries, boysenberries, loganberries and plums, with a dusting of clove and pepper. But for all that fruit, it's totally dry.",84,US,California,Shiraz,12
17491,"Soft and ripe in extracted cherry and blackberry jam fruit, this also has some heat on the palate, the result of 15% alcohol. It feels a little simple, and the heat is off-putting.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
148182,"Tremendous aromatics on this young wine: a blast of refined cassis, cedar, pine cone, green olives and even roasted meat. Rich and forward in ripe fruit character, and the bigtime tannins are polished. This is an excellent but very young wine. Should peak in 5–7 years.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,175
49134,"Made in the popular style, with vanilla oak, cream and sweet buttered popcorn notes dominating the pineapples, apricots and peaches. Production was 8,093 cases.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,20
39141,"Happily, each new vintage of Bésoleil is a bit larger than the previous year, so more people can taste what a joy this wine is. In 2008 it's 82% Grenache, 9% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre. As with all the Betz wines, it is intensely aromatic. The wine glass fairly explodes with scents of grape, plum, raspberry and cherry. In the mouth grace notes offer hints of leaf and fresh herb. Plush and irresistible.",93,US,Washington,Grenache,45
147930,"Tastes like good grapes forced into over-production, to judge from the watery finish. It's still a good wine, with blackcurrant flavors, but you wish it was more intense, especially from this historic label.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,30
110523,"From several vineyard sites, this lot selection is tropical and rich on the nose, as well as honeyed and thick on the palate, showing its youthful vigor and the density of the vintage. Fig and papaya meet orange and lemon before a toasted note of coconut oak rises on the finish.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,38
24,"San Jose-based producer Adam Comartin heads 1,100 feet up into the mountains to source fruit for this tremendous wine, which offers wild cherry, sage, and eucalyptus scents on the nose. Ripe black plum and strawberry fruit lead the palate, followed by acid-driven waves of juniper, pine and bay leaf, finishing with a menthol-like sensation.",95,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
1248,"This superpremium effort from Precept Brands is loaded with fruit, and crafted with winemaker Charlie Hoppes' trademark style—lush oak, giving generous barrel flavors of butterscotch and toast. The barrel flavors dominate, complemented by bold black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit.",88,US,Washington,Red Blend,50
81384,"Smells hot and rubbery,  cherry cola-like and syrupy, not a good sign. In the mouth, it's awkwardly sweet and gluey, with the flavor of sweetened rose hip tea, and fairly hefty tannins. Not going anywhere. —S.H.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,13
9057,"Dark raspberry, barrel spice and smoke aromas are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency. Perhaps some time in the bottle will help them settle.",89,US,Washington,Merlot,50
79808,"This tasty, balanced wine is leaner than some of its peers. Green apple and white peach aromas lead to apple and light citrus flavors. The crisp acidity lines up nicely, making it a versatile partner for food.",89,US,California,Grenache Blanc,24
88700,"A simple, sweet blush bubbly, this is rough in texture, with raspberry, strawberry and vanilla flavors. It should be fine with wedding cake.",84,US,California,Sparkling Blend,22
10770,"Trefethen has been on a roll the last few years, producing some of Napa's most spectacular Cabernets. This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years. This beauty is just now beginning its long journey. Drink now–2020.",95,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,175
120033,"An herbal, bright, red berry nose is followed by flavors of plum, white pepper and cherry. A gentle wine that's easy to drink and a good pairing to more delicate dishes.",84,US,New York,Pinot Noir,12
37217,This pale salmon-colored wine shows bright aromas of watermelon and strawberry. The palate drinks dry with mouthwateringly tart fruit flavors.,88,US,Washington,Grenache,18
49186,"The vineyard, planted in 2003, is located on the Oregon side of the Columbia River. The young vines bring bright, effusive fruit flavors of raspberries and strawberry pastry, black cherries and plums. Aromatically there are whiffs of violets and spun sugar. All in all a most inviting, fruit-driven Malbec.",90,US,Washington,Malbec,20
75387,"A fine Cabernet, this is dry, full bodied and softly tannic, with real Napa elegance. Feels smooth in the mouth, offering concentrated blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and sweet oak flavors. Drink over the next six years.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
115025,"This has striking aromas of passion fruit, apricot and pear drop, with a note of warm, spiced green apple adding dimension. While sweet in nature, this has electrifying acidity that keeps the palate clean, energetic and far from clingy. The acidity remains racy on the finish, highlighting the pretty honeysuckle character.",87,US,America,Vignoles,14
83098,"Fruit stars front and center in this crisply clean, young Pinot Grigio. The mouth is flooded with ripe pineapples, Meyer lemons, kiwis, white peaches and honey.",85,US,California,Pinot Grigio,17
77867,"Showing lovely, delicate orange and citron flavors, this Sauvignon Blanc is clean and zesty in acidity. It's so refreshingly dry, and has such a tangy minerality, that it's a pleasure to drink as a cocktail sipper.",88,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,12
46569,"Intensely oaky, this Carneros Pinot is brooding in ripe plum fruit and straightforwardly layered with approachable fruit flavor and mellowing tannins. Enjoy now.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
122475,"Too green and acidic to earn a higher score, although it's pleasantly dry and clean, and there are some savory citrus flavors. But they're dominated by tart leafy tobacco and feline notes.",82,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
104717,"A bit on the sugary sweet side, but otherwise this is a nice cocktail sipper. Shows good acidity coupled with pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and spice flavors. Would score much higher if it were drier.",85,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
74700,"Chardonnays of this caliber are very price-sensitive, but for $10 or less, this is a good value. It's like a photocopy of a truly rich Chardonnay, but all the parts are there, making this Chard good for everyday drinking.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,10
112740,"Full-bodied, juicy, off-dry and forward. Immediately approachable and plenty flavorful, with streaks of tea, lemon and tangerine.",88,US,Oregon,Riesling,18
23232,"Basically dry, this Vermentino is crisp in acidity and forward in lemon, lime and tangerine fruit. It's a nice, easy drinking wine to try as a switch from Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio.",86,US,California,Vermentino,18
18900,"Lots of rich flavors of blackberry, black currant, bacon, pepper and clove in this Syrah, which comes from the winery's big vineyard on Spring Mountain. Feels luxurious in the mouth, with a silky texture and a deep, long finish. It's a bit brusque in tannins, but that's part of its structural distinction. Drink it over the next few years.",92,US,California,Syrah,55
51465,"There's good structure to this Cabernet, thanks to the firm tannins and ample acidity. But the flavors take the starring role, with raspberries, cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. It has a light, delicate mouthfeel, although there's nothing light about the taste. It's complex and ageable, so give it until 2020 to begin to come around.",95,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,126
116577,"Ah, the Resonance vineyard! This is a magic spot that consistently makes the best wines from this top winery. In 2006 elegance is the keynote; with everything in perfect proportion and the fruit, acid, tannin and barrel notes in perfect harmony. The wine is young, almost austere, and the flavors are compact and wedged together, but they are there to be found if you sniff and look. The fruit is concentrated in the back of the palate and this wine perfectly captures an Oregon aesthetic without any of the rough edges or rawness. Will it age? The bet from here is it will go another 20 years.",94,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,48
17270,"Michael Mondavi's Folio Fine Wine Partners now offers an Oregon Pinot Noir, this one vinified by Rob Mondavi, a fourth- generation winemaker. Pale and elegantly styled, it shows refined winemaking skills and a European sensibility. Pungently herbal, this supple wine brings young fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry, but shows ageworthy depth and persistence. It's the sort of subtle, classic style that rewards both time and attention.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,35
93923,"Soft and sensual, this Pinot is a real charmer. With a texture as plush as velvet, it offers a tapestry of cherry, black raspberry, currant, chocolate, orange zest and anise flavors that go on and on. Best now for its sheer lusciousness.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,34
119744,"Simple and sweet, with flavors of black cherry jam, gingerbread, licorice and crystalized brown sugar.",84,US,California,Merlot,14
119533,"A true sensation. Shows the richness and concentration you want in a great Napa Cab, but also a structure that lifts it above the soft, mushy wines that are so prevalent. There's real tannin and acid architecture framing the opulent blackberry, black currant, mineral and cedar flavors, and the finish is dry, dry, dry. Every sip offers something different as it changes in the glass. A world-class wine that defines elegance, power and complexity. Should age effortlessly for at least a decade.",97,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,150
43300,"Ripe in green apple, banana and pineapple, this is a heavily barrel-influenced wine, intense in petroleum and toasty vanilla. Save this for buttery lobster or risotto dishes.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,16
134711,"With mostly Chardonnay and a little of the Symphony grape, this is a fruity, deliciously gulpable wine showing intense peach, pear, apple and vanilla-cinnamon flavors.",85,US,California,White Blend,9
103481,"A bit of a muted nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Merlot (24%), Petit Verdot (22%), Cab Franc (11%) and Malbec (1%) out of the Livermore Valley. A good balance of fruit and tannic power here, but not a ton of depth. The finish drops off a bit, too.",86,US,California,Meritage,35
92196,"A great Pinot Grigio, the kind that restaurateurs should scoop up for their by-the-glass program. Dryish and refreshingly tart, it offers flavors of pineapples, pears, honeysuckle, vanilla and pepper spice. Easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced.",88,US,California,Pinot Grigio,15
70902,"A delicious Talley Rincon, showing the class of this vineyard. Maybe not the best vintage, lacking some elegance, but the wine is ultrarich and full-bodied, with massive raspberry and cherry flavors. Drink soon.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,58
77752,"Looming in huge black fruit, this is a dark, heavy Zin intense in toasty oak and brambly, dusty amounts of ripe blackberry and strawberry jam. Dark chocolate hammers in hard on the finish, with black pepper and raisins.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,24
121786,"This is a smooth, easy-drinking, chocolaty Cabernet. The ripe red fruit is laced with streaks of black olive, mushroom and loam. Barrel aging in both American and French oak (half new) brings in coffee and chocolate.",88,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,29
16252,"Tart and acidic, this does not entirely disguise its green-bean scents with aging in French oak, 30% new. That sweet oak sticks out, but the tannins are chalky and the fruit hard to find.",86,US,Oregon,Cabernet Sauvignon,32
46854,"A wonderfully complex, dry white wine, rich and acidic, with subtle flavors of citrus fruits, white flowers, vanilla, minerals and honey. Feels smooth and creamy, an interesting combination of richness and tartness and, above all, elegance. Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Viognier and Grenache Blanc.",92,US,California,White Blend,25
71,"Big oak defines this robustly dense and extracted red, swimming in vanilla and cherry flavor. Full-bodied and gravelly in texture, it's a rustically pleasant wine for pizza nights and crowds.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
125777,"A really nice, dry wine that stimulates the mouth with crisp acidity, then offers waves of interesting, complex flavors. Lemons, limes and pineapples are accented with richer notes of papayas and honeysuckle, finishing in a swirl of spice. Good as an exotic alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.",89,US,California,Torrontés,15
12483,"While the Finger Lakes region is better known for Riesling, this gorgeously composed single-vineyard Cabernet Franc sets a benchmark for American red wine. The nose is delicately perfumed of violet, lavender and autumn leaves. On the palate, swirls of luscious black fruit juxtapose layers of granite and stone. Briskly balanced, yet endlessly persistent on the finish, it's a standout bottling that's well worth seeking out.",94,US,New York,Cabernet Franc,32
22736,"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the ‘05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,98
70743,Muscat gummy and herb aromas are followed by dry tropical fruit and ale flavors that are lightly styled. Drink now.,83,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,15
104175,"This Cab Franc has some nice features, starting with the cherry and herb flavors that finish dry and spicy. It's a bit rough-edged right out of the bottle, but the combination of decanting and drinking it with a rich, fatty steak will improve it tremendously at the table.",87,US,California,Cabernet Franc,42
55541,"This electric-pink-colored wine is a saignée-blend of Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Barbera. Aromas of cherry and herb lead to broad off-dry tangy cherry flavors that don't seem fully connected together.",82,US,Washington,Rosé,35
81302,"This bottling from esteemed producer Williams Selyem is a rich, concentrated wine, brimming with savory flavors of wild cherries and raspberries, red currants, milk chocolate, cloves and black pepper. The extraordinary tannins are smooth and as fine as velvet.",91,US,California,Zinfandel,48
837,"While relatively full-bodied and tannic, this wine also has friendly, fresh berry and cherry flavors that are held in place by very firm acidity and tannins. It feels and tastes generous but also strong and taut, so it should improve with a little time. Best to drink now through 2020.",90,US,California,Syrah,22
38306,"This is rich and appealing now for its ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry that taste as if they were baked in a sweet, smoky pie crust. The acidity provides a pleasant tartness. It should age well over the next 3–5 years.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,49
72847,"This may be a little sweet, hot and heavy, but it has such rich flavors of berry, currant, spice and mocha that it's easy to drink with ribs, chicken, burgers or vegetarian lasagna.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,29
90144,"Costing the equivalent of $5 for one 750-ml bottle, this is made in a country style, with a jagged mouthfeel and berry flavors that are tinged with green mint and chlorophyll.",82,US,California,Red Blend,20
41727,"Extremely spicy on the nose, with clove, black cardamom, gingerbread and more baking spice, this bottling also shows aromas of concentrated hibiscus, soy sauce and beef teriyaki. A black-rock minerality powers the palate, alongside buttered cherries, charred beef, pipe smoke, fudge and lifting menthol flavors.",92,US,California,Petite Sirah,35
143611,"Comes on a bit flat, with a streak of cardboard under the fruit. Not as fresh as it should be, given the vintage.",81,US,Washington,Riesling,14
57250,"Merlot (59%) takes the lead on this blend, which is balanced out by Cabernet Franc. Intriguing aromas of herbs, flowers, spice raspberries, café au lait and barrel spices lead to silky, polished fruit and barrel flavors that linger.",90,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,35
75667,"Made in an exceptionally ripe manner, this Pinot brims with cherry and raspberry pie filling fruit that's so rich, it's almost like a dessert, except the finish is dry. Oak adds delicious complications of sweet, caramelized vanilla and char. This is quite a good wine, but it's a little on the young side. Give it 2–3 years to begin to come around.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,36
54493,"Dark and heavy for a Pinot Noir, although it's certainly well made and delicious. Floods the mouth with cherry and raspberry pie-filling fruit, and the smoky, caramelized oak has a granola sweetness. Drink now.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,65
120492,"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,36
44080,"Delicate and pale, this elegant rosé hints at rhubarb and strawberry, dappled with light herbs. Tart and refreshing.",86,US,Oregon,Rosé,16
80346,"This Cabernet-based blend includes all the other classic Bordeaux varieties. Aged in 35% new French oak, it's soft and sweetly gentle, with flavors of cherry-pie filling and blackberry as well as a touch of buttered toast. Drink now.",87,US,California,Meritage,30
32797,"The raspberry and cherry flavors are a bit obvious at first, but then the balanced tannins and acids become apparent, and the tasteful application of sweet, smoky oak surfaces. This wine grows more interesting as it sits in the glass. Drink it now and over the next 3–4 years for maximum freshness.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,55
119213,"This 100% Viognier was grown in the Bien Nacido Vineyard. It's bone dry, crisp in acidity and firm in wet stone minerals, while the rich fruit flavors suggest fresh, juicy citron, quince and sweet lime. Just wonderful, a bracing, pure, clean and pure example of a variety that can often be fussy.",95,US,California,Viognier,60
103126,"Beckmen is one of Santa Barbara's premier Rhône-style producers, and one of the few wineries that understands how to get Grenache right. This one, which has been blended with a little Syrah is just wonderful. It's not only delicious in fruits and spices, but it's balanced, with superb acidity and a bracing coating of tannin.",94,US,California,Grenache,45
90342,"A faint yeastiness subsides to expose luxurious aromas of violet, white peach and green herb on this single-vineyard Riesling. Lushly textured with flavors of yellow cherry and stone fruit, it has a steely, minerally tone that persists through the long finish.",88,US,New York,Riesling,27
107724,"Mer Soleil Chards seem to get bigger, riper and oakier every year. Of course, this is the winery's style, and when it works, the results can be fabulously rich, but this caramelized wine seems a little top-heavy.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,42
71924,"There is lots of charm in this soft, gentle Pinot Noir. It's not an ager, but it offers some nice cherry, Dr. Pepper and spice flavors.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,20
23156,"Since 2009, the producer has sourced from this site, a relatively warm pocket of the northern reaches of the appellation. Vibrant in red cherry fruit, it's also layered and velvety smooth, with astructure and density that makes it complex and compelling. The fruit dances in blackberry as well as strawberry, with a subtle herbal undertone.",90,US,California,Syrah,40
93257,"A brilliant Chardonnay, easily deserving its Reserve status. Crisp and dry, it houses opulent flavors of ripe tropical fruits, butterscotch, roasted hazelnuts, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,30
128169,"A sensual aroma of musky spice and strawberry starts this wine out well. On the palate, the wine offers an interesting mix of delicate, dancing flavors and rounder, bigger spice. Unique, with some heft.",86,US,New York,Pinot Noir,13
122097,"This full-bodied, velvet-textured wine has an exotic aroma like a pine forest and tastes like a bowl full of blueberries. Ripe, almost jammy flavors coat the tongue, and vibrate with black currant on the finish. Fine-grained tannins give the texture lots of grip, and support the ripe fruit flavors so they stay dry and appetizing sip after sip.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
126423,"At the age of more than eight years, this 100% Cabernet remains powerful with blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's just starting to show bottle complexity, with the tannins softening and the fruit gaining earthy tones. A criticism is the alcohol, which is high and doesn't seem to lose its heat. Drink now.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,95
53704,"This wine comes from Weinbau, Lady Hawk, Champoux, Shaw and Obelisco vineyards. Its high toned vanilla, toffee, cherry, herb, coffee, barrel spice and plum aromas lead to generous cherry and espresso flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide support.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,30
120984,A strong earthy aroma leads to lean fruit and veggie flavors in this medium-bodied wine.,82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
106410,"There's a wild, brooding, forest quality to this dark young wine. It erupts in brambly aromas suggesting roasted meat, pine tar, wild cherries and raspberries, chamomile and nettles. Pinot purists might find it a bit tannic and heavy, but it's certainly an exotic style, and could do interesting things in the cellar.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,65
91818,"Although this Cab is very dry, it's a bit astringent, with hard, edgy tannins and blackberry fruit flavors that veer into raisins. At its best now, so drink up.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,55
113522,"Burnished gold in color, with aromas of custard, lemon curd, toast and baked apples. The flavor profile is an amalgam of dull pear and apple, while the finish is heavy as it deals coconut and tropical fruit. Overall it's a soft, fading Chardonnay that can be summed up in one taste.",84,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,16
31659,"This wine comes from the recently awarded Malibu appellation, and shows promise for the future with perfumey white flowers, toasted marcona almond and a hint of oak smoke on the nose. On the palate, the acidity is present but not overpowering, the ripe apple flesh flavors offset by a grapefruit pith bitterness",89,US,California,Chardonnay,39
93609,"There's no Merlot in California that's richer or more decadent than this. The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious. Granted, the wine is a little soft, with a melted texture, and classicists will complain it's made in the International style. They're missing out on a real hedonistic pleasure.",94,US,California,Merlot,75
10893,"Big in flavor, with a touch of ripely rounded heat, this wine dances in coconut and black olive flavors, a sweet savoriness that's enhanced by cedar and pencil seasonings. The finish comes with a bittersweet taste of tobacco.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,120
1928,"This Merlot is dry, full-bodied and delicious in fruit and oak. Black cherries, currants, mocha, plums, vanilla and fragrant sandalwood all come together to provide a complex drink that's firm in tannins and fancy in the finish. Drink now.",90,US,California,Merlot,28
62368,"Has weird aromas of cooked mushrooms and asparagus, but strangely, it tastes pretty good, with berry flavors and a dry, softly tannic structure. Not a bad wine, except for that odd smell.",81,US,California,Merlot,10
14026,"Fruity and spicy, offering a blast of briary forest berry and spice flavors and a tannic, brambly mouthfeel. It's nicely dry, yet can't quite overcome a certain rusticity.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,30
86946,"Made from vines planted in 1965, David Hill's estate Riesling is aromatic and textural, with an interesting, nuanced character that brings apples, peaches, pears and passion fruit flavors in profusion. Despite 1.8% residual sugar, it has plenty of acid and alcohol, finishing with a creamy, lemony fade.",90,US,Oregon,Riesling,14
30942,"Only the faint smell of grass emerges from this wine, but the palate is another story, with fresh squeezed lime and brisk nectarine flavors. The mouthfeel starts rich and then zips up tight with nice acidity. This vibrant wine needs food that's both rich and exotic, so try Chinese or Indonesian.",88,US,California,Viognier,41
22811,"Don't let the Red Wine label fool you. This is 92% Syrah with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon. It provides immediate appeal with its aromas of raspberry, plummy fruit, orange peel and chocolate. The palate has full-bodied, sumptuous flavors that linger. Drink now.",91,US,Washington,Red Blend,32
51781,"Syrah is still finding its way in Washington, and a certain sameness affects many of these wines. This tastes like the product of relatively young vines; spicy, leafy and lightly peppery, with tart cranberry and raspberry fruit, it's balanced and similar to a lighter Zin from the Dry Creek Valley; tasty and fresh, without over-reaching.",87,US,Washington,Syrah,32
22363,"Extraordinarily rich and complicated in flavors, this wine comes from vineyards that are at least 50 years old. It's dry and spicy, with textbook Zin notes of wild berries and currants, but also exotic minerals that come from the soil. Yes, the alcohol is high, but that is the signature of Seghesio's marvelous Zinfandels.",92,US,California,Zinfandel,36
109149,"There's not much to like in this dry, harsh, acidic wine. It's thin and minty, with an astringent finish. The wine tastes like the vines were overcropped.",81,US,California,Syrah,14
63298,"They dropped the price and upped the quality this year on this dry, field-style blend of Syrah, Zin, Sangiovese, Petite Sirah and Grenache. With its earthy, leather and wild berry flavors and fine, gritty tannins, it's a good match for a grilled steak.",86,US,California,Red Blend,12
70575,"Taut and crisp compared to the softer, riper Magdalena or Josef Vineyard bottlings, this polished, steely wine is a showcase of brash mineral style. It's dry on the palate, but flavors of white grapefruit and lime seem kissed with a spray of honey. Drinks beautifully now but should continue to improve through at least 2025.",94,US,New York,Riesling,39
35029,"A deliciously complex Chardonnay, nearly as good as the winery's single-vineyard wines, which makes it a great value. Smooth and clean, it shows vanilla cream, pineapple tart, Key lime pie and buttered toast flavors. Vibrant acidity keeps it all uplifted and bright.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,24
56363,"This is the best of Testarossa's Spring-release Pinots. It shows the pedigree of the vineyard, a big, rich, almost heavy young Pinot Noir whose cherry, spice and smoky cedar flavors are accented with fine acidity and rich tannins. Should age well for up to a decade.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,65
11714,"Dry and soft in tannins, this exudes rich blackberry, grilled prosciutto and black pepper flavors. Made for drinking now, it shows real Santa Lucia  elegance at an affordable price.",87,US,California,Syrah,20
101912,"Lots of delicious, lip-smacking flavors in this high alcohol Zinfandel. It's technically dry, but so sweet in grilled berry, glycerine and caramelized oak, it could double as a dessert wine to drink with a chocolate coconut pie.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,32
22137,"Grown on Antinori's original property, high on Atlas Peak, although you'd never know it from searching the front or back labels. It's a very fine wine, dry and elegantly constructed, with little of the baby fat over-the-topness that affects some Napa Cabs. Within that firm structure are extraordinarily complex blackberry, black currant and spicy plum flavors. Delicious now despite the firm tannins, and should develop over the next 8–10 years, at least.",94,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,55
51208,"A good, rich Syrah that shows its cool-climate origins in the peppery notes, dryness and finely ground tannins. It's a big, powerful wine, long and deep in currant, mushu plum sauce and grilled meat flavors, and is best enjoyed in its youth with like-minded foods.",87,US,California,Syrah,29
67433,"So fresh and inviting with aromas of apple cider, pear slices and pineapple core. More of the same unfolds in the mouth with soft accents of smoke appearing on the end of the finish. Balanced with medium weight and acidity; an excellent option for outdoor grilling, at an attractive price.",88,US,New York,Chardonnay,18
110547,"Frankly sweet, this Riesling, made only from cool coastal grapes, benefits from crisp acidity. The tartness balances the sugary peach, citrus and honeysuckle flavors.",83,US,California,Riesling,10
28729,"Rosé should be dry, delicate and crisp in acidity. This Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah blend succeeds on two of those levels, but not dryness. The raspberry fruit has a simple jamminess that's almost dessert-style.",84,US,California,Rosé,20
121031,This wine shows a lot of reduction that provides off-putting aromas. The strawberry and cranberry flavors are full and show pleasing purity and length. The disconnect between the aromas and flavors is substantial but some time in a decanter might sync them up.,88,US,Washington,Grenache,27
38630,"Ripe tangerine, peach, green apple and vanilla flavors combine with brisk, citrusy acidity in this wine. This wine saw a touch of neutral oak, which seems to have contributed a smoky toast character. It picks up complexities as it warms and airs, so don't drink this too cold.",87,US,California,Grenache Blanc,25
58411,"A dry, gentle Merlot, likeable for its rich tannic structure and complex flavors. Shows berry, cherry, currant, dark chocolate and sandalwood flavors, with a clean, spicy finish. Drink now with a nice grilled steak, brushed with garlic butter and plenty of pepper.",88,US,California,Merlot,26
26891,"This is a beautiful, complex and complete wine, from the delicate, spiced raspberry aroma through the creamy, nuanced finish. Subtle but well-defined fruit flavors like white cherry and raspberry pulse across the palate, buoyed by an ultrafine effervescence and lively acidity. But the texture is smooth around the edges, lending a sense of extra depth and layering to this extraordinary bottle. Just coming into its own now, it will improve through at least 2020.",96,US,California,Rosé,150
95802,"This bright, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc is full of mouthwatering grapefruit and lemon flavors. It's delicately framed, yet cutting and spry with a mineral-tinged backbone that begs for pairing with oysters and other briny seafood.",90,US,New York,Sauvignon Blanc,24
61457,"Nice and crisp in acidity, with ripe peach, apple and pineapple flavors. There's a bite of green sharpness on the finish, but it's still a good Chard.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,24
52191,"A soft, pleasant Chardonnay that has some extra features beyond the ripe, oaky fruit flavors. There's a fatness and opulence to it, with sweet flavors of honey, pineapples and buttered toast that finish long and dry. Best consumed now.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,45
83392,"Sourced from the Boushey Vineyard, this is a tart take on Sauvignon Blanc. Once past the acid rush, you'll find a tightly focused wine, with laser-like precision and a wealth of mineral and lemon flavors.",88,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,25
106738,"This is a dry, soft Syrah with some dusty tannins you'll have to negotiate, but a grilled steak, or almost anything with a BBQ char, should do well. The underlying flavors are delicious, a wealth of blackberries, cherries, currants, datenut cookie, licorice and Asian spices. Drink now.",89,US,California,Syrah,25
85391,"Dryish and tart in acidity, this has flavors of citrus, tropical fruit, Asian pear and green apple, marked by that distinctly Riesling note of diesel fuel.",87,US,California,Riesling,18
32547,"This is a one-dimensional wine, and it offers confected raspberry and club soda notes that rule the nose and palate. It's light bodied and sweet tasting.",82,US,Virginia,Rosé,18
104685,"The high alcohol shows through everything else, giving this Zin a chili pepper heat and a distracting Port-like sensation. It's rich and dry, with firm tannins framing the blackberry and currant flavors.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,30
5282,"Aromas recall overripe pear, tin, pineapple, grass and mineral. The lightly tropical flavors seem dilute backed by green apple-like acidity.",84,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,13
94559,"Sourced mostly from Lodi, Spellbound's Cabernet has most of what you want from an inexpensive red wine: a pretty nose, a good balance of tannin, with dark fruit and a big, juicy finish. Cedar and tobacco notes are found too, for those who prefer their wines on the savory side.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
123420,"This is barrel fermented, with noticeable flavors of heavily buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Bright with crisp acidity, it also features notes of ripe pineapple, pear, peach and mango.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,15
40136,"Thickly concentrated in a rich style, this wine also possesses a balanced backbone of citrus and melon flavor, made more decadent by accompanying marshmallow and vanilla bean notes.",87,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,16
111563,"Better known for Edna Valley Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, Carpe Diem now turns to Napa Cab. Although it's a clean Cab with some elegance, it's lean and herbal, lacking the opulence Napa Cab ought to have.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,22
95465,"Klopp is a mix of California and Burgundy clones, one of the producer's finest offerings every year, made in an opulent, balanced style. Lush layers of strawberry and cherry are surrounded by truffle-like dirt. The wine is concentrated in tannin and subtle oak, while anise marks the measured finish. The wine will benefit from time in the cellar through 2020.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
140651,"This is classic Washingon Merlot; plush with dark and smoky fruit, a supple and muscular mouthfeel, and broad flavors of plum and cherry. The generous (80%) use of new French oak adds plenty of chocolate and spice. Klipsun fruit can sometimes be rough and tannic, but here it is supple and almost soft, like real Corinthian leather.",91,US,Washington,Red Blend,45
99108,"Good, tangy red fruit, with youthful vigor and zest. Nuances of citrus rind, cranberry and toast; it's compact and sleek, still young and tight, but perfectly balanced and precision-tuned.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,28
72177,"This wine is roughly half estate-grown and half Shaw vineyard, all on Red Mountain. Along with tart berry fruit comes a generous dash of fresh herbs, clean earth and a bit of stem. Medium long in the finish, it carries a pleasant streak of toasty oak.",88,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,36
119388,"Sugary-sweet, like a mixture of lemonade and pineapple juice, with a squeeze of orange. If you like this style, it's for you.",82,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,12
98947,"Strawberries are the core of the fruit here, with plenty of acidity behind. The wine thins out quickly in the midpalate, and finishes high-toned and lightly fruity.",85,US,Washington,Barbera,19
19026,"Winemaker Denis Malbec has created a brilliantly delicious, crisp, dry yet richly textured version of the variety that opens with golden honey, dried apricot and lychee on the nose and mouth. Very minerally, the wine has a steely finish with smoky, oaky edges.",91,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,36
18677,"Easily the best MacMurray Ranch Pinot Noir ever. Shows impressive depth and complexity, with rich flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, pomegranates, persimmons and smoky sandalwood, finished with tangy Asian spices. Tastes a bit jammy, suggesting a few years in the bottle.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
73237,"A reserve-level, barrel-fermented cuvée, this has a fresh and creamy mouthfeel. It blends crisp tree fruits with bracing minerality, and finishes lightly with a pat of butter.",92,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,60
127622,"This lower-priced Pinot from the Center of Effort team punches way above its weight in this vintage, showing light cherry-blossom and black-cherry aromas mixed with gamy meat and wet slate. Blackberry pie is cut with orange rind on the sip, with an earthy grip showing flavors of juniper, crushed clove and pipe tobacco.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,19
143740,"This is a light-bodied, soft wine that glides like silk in the mouth. It has a nice balance of cherry-blueberry flavors and earthy, coffee bean notes, and is very dry and tart with acids.",85,US,California,Grenache,20
101685,"This is a strong Zinfandel. It takes over the mouth with a blast of ripe blackberry, cherry, anise, chocolate and spice. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power.",90,US,California,Zinfandel,35
37378,"Ripe and flashy, an only-in-California Pinot Noir brimming with pie filling raspberry and cherry flavors. It's brightened with excellent acidity.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
31189,"This blend of Barbera, Petite Sirah and other red varieties tastes hearty, fruity, full flavored and full bodied, without being too tannic to enjoy easily. Aromas like blackberry jam and flavors reminiscent of dark plum and spicy, smoky oak make it tempting and delicious. Enough fresh acidity keeps it balanced.",90,US,California,Red Blend,34
120445,"Inviting aromas of blackberry preserve on rye toast, cigar box, split pine, dill and black olive show on this single vineyard expression by Billy Wathen. Lifted by a slowly simmering acidity, the palate is earthy and forest-driven, with mushroom, juniper, pine needle, strawberry and dried mint flavors.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,54
128193,"Softly layered in crisp red fruit, from currant to strawberry, this is a medium-bodied wine with a medium finish, seasoned in compelling jolts of cinnamon spice. From the relatively cool climes of its appellation, it's juicy without ever becoming overwhelming in tannin.",87,US,California,Merlot,35
19084,"This complement to the Lost Soul Syrah comes from the other end of the Yakima Valley, the Red Mountain vineyards of Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval. Cranberry and strawberry fruit shows good concentration. It's a compact wine with plenty of minerality from the vineyard sources, and an extended finish once it gets some breathing time.",91,US,Washington,Syrah,48
97516,"Feels muscular and dry in the mouth, with powerful black cherry, currant, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are potent, but negotiable, although you should give this Syrah a decant of several hours to let it breathe.",88,US,California,Syrah,20
6073,"This blend of 40% Mourvèdre, 30% Syrah, 21% Grenache and 9% Counoise shows a dense core of fruit on the fresh, tart nose, with blueberry, blackberry and boysenberry, as well as lava rocks and a licorice lift. The palate is all about texture, with good acidity and grip containing the purple fruit flavors",89,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,55
111246,"There's a weird discrepancy between the aroma, which is watery, and the flavor, which is very sweet and rich in apricot honey, marzipan, butterscotch and vanilla fudge. If flavor's all you need, this is a satisfying dessert wine.",85,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,19
121894,"Rich and smooth in tannins, with some sharpness through the finish, this shows masses of ripe blackberries and dark chocolate. A bit of time in the glass reprises and accentuates the chocolaty richness. Despite its power, this is refined and high toned, a serious cellar candidate. Give it 10–15 years.",96,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,335
25868,"Named for winemaker Virginie Bourgue, this entirely stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc has a grassy, spicy edge reminiscent of Loire Valley whites. It's also tongue-twistingly tart, a reflection of the vintage, like a lemon explosion in the mouth. In other words, this is a perfect seafood wine.",88,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,22
6432,"An outstanding Cabernet that shows its pedigreed origin in every respect. The aroma is profound with black currants, flavors deep and concentrated, and tannins as smooth and complex as Napa can produce. So beautiful now, it's hard to resist drinking it, but this lovely wine should improve for a decade, slowly developing in the bottle.",95,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,165
60755,"With too much oak and too sweet fruit, the result is an unbalanced Chardonnay. It tastes like LifeSaver lemon candies cooked into a baked Alaska dessert.",82,US,California,Chardonnay,30
25393,"A rich, dry young Cabernet, with fresh blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, brightened by a burst of citrusy acidity. The tannins are strong, however, giving the wine a sandpapery astringency. Needs a few years, although it doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul. Your window is around 2014.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
105092,"Sadly, only one barrel was made of this exceptional wine, from what may be the best site for Malbec in the entire state. It's a mouth-teasing mix of plum, cherry, cola, chocolate and clean loam, with silky tannins and a hint of Bourbon on the finish.",93,US,Washington,Malbec,40
63157,"This is an impressive bottling with complex caramel, toasted nut and tropical fruit aromas. It's big bodied and coats the mouth with rich butterscotch, banana, apple and toasty oak flavors. A touch short on acid, it could use bit more backbone, but it's still big on toasty style. Its long, satisfying finish is an oak lover's paradise.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,30
117924,"Here's one for the cellar. You could drink it now, with a little decanting, but such is the structural youth that you'd miss this Bordeaux blend at its best. Rich and savory in spicy black and red currant, cherry and cedar flavors, the wine shows a firm tannic structure, with a crisp bite of acidity. Hold until late 2008; should evolve over the next six to eight years.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,48
112669,"Richer and more balanced than the two previous vintages, with opulent cherry pastry filling, blackberry, blueberry, cocoa and spice flavors that are superripe, but essentially dry. Good tannins and acids, too. A wine to watch.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,19
92851,"Known more for Zinfandel and Rhône blends, Bill Easton has quietly been making Cabernet as well for many years. This vintage is earthy and leathery, reminiscent of his Syrah-based wines, yet rich in savory black cherry, cedar and black olive. Built to age, put it away until 2019–2024 and the savory, herbal elements are sure to develop further.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
68642,"Tight, tart and lightly spicy, this leads with raspberry and strawberry fruit, amplified with moderately high acids. In the mouth it feels more like a Washington Cabernet than a Merlot—Merlots in this state usually have more midpalate weight and flesh.",85,US,Washington,Merlot,14
34625,"A rugged, rustic wine, with sugary sweet and sour flavors of cherries. The texture is disagreeable.",82,US,California,Syrah,17
91321,Dundee Hills Pinot doesn't come along at this price very often. This is classy and well defined. Strong citrus flavors frame a core of plum and chocolate. It will benefit from another couple of years of bottle aging. Drink 2018 to 2022.,88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,25
11613,"Intensely ripe, this is a straightforward wine with upfront cherry jam and oak flavors. Not much else going on, but it's fine for a party.",83,US,California,Merlot,15
84979,"This takes ripe fruit and oak influence to the limits, with powerful flavors of buttered toast, pineapple, orange jam and vanilla-cream. This defines the flashy style of California Chardonnay, with a honeyed finish.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,45
66151,"Peter Rosback's old-vine Zin is always dark and dense and unabashedly alcoholic (15.8%). In this vintage more herbal flavors dominate, along with olives, dates, figs and a decidedly salty note. Unique and not for everyone, but absolutely exceptional.",93,US,Oregon,Zinfandel,36
111730,"A bit harsh in acids and sharp tannins, this Merlot offers earthy, herbal cherry and currant flavors, rounded off with smoky oak influences. Drink now.",84,US,California,Merlot,29
102079,"Concentrated but crisp black-plum and cherry flavors are accented by savory hints of mushroom, toast and spice in this surprisingly elegant Chelois, a French-American hybrid variety. Slightly puckering acidity lends balance to a rich fleshy mouthfeel. Fine tannins frame a taut finish. Drink now through 2020.",87,US,New York,Chelois,25
148694,"Though it's the least expensive of Seven Hills' four Cabernets, this wine is just a step behind the others. There is good concentration in the color and in the nose, with cassis fruit pushing through a tight, compact structure. Fine balance with firm acids and some interesting mineral flavors, plus a hint of coffee in the finish. Editors' Choice.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
128725,"A complicated and interesting Zinfandel with lots to recommend it, and at a pretty good price. The wine is dry and tannic, but gentle enough to drink now. It has appealing flavors of blackberry tart, red currants and cola, liberally dusted with black pepper, anise and vanilla, and finished with sweet, smoky sandalwood. Feels lush and elegant and classy through the long, spicy finish.",92,US,California,Zinfandel,25
34161,"Simple, dry and direct. The silky texture houses slightly green flavors of tea, cherries and cola. Ready now.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,23
107755,"The major defect of this wine is excessive sweetness. Without the sugary flavor, it would be great, for it has wonderfully crisp acidity and flavors of citrus fruits, peaches and minerals.",83,US,California,Verdelho,16
58248,"A rich, brisk and complex Chardonnay that shows cool-climate structure and the ripe fruit that comes from a good vintage and great viticulture, in a difficult growing region. The pineapple, pear and golden mango flavors are enriched with lots of smoky, buttery oak, and offset with crisp acidity. Decadent and delicious.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,40
54584,"This fresh Riesling offers crisp apple and spice on the nose and palate, as well as honeysuckle and citrus. Delicate and mild, it's not terribly intellectual, but an easygoing summer sip.",83,US,Michigan,Riesling,17
9627,"Planted in 1983, this is the original Willamette Valley Vineyards estate vineyard. The wine remains stiff and wrapped up tight, with a mix of wild strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit. There's a light dusting of baking spices, the result of aging 14 months in one-quarter new French oak.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,65
3334,"Faithful to its label, this zero-degree residual-sugar Riesling is stark, steely and intensely dry. Bracing lemon acidity and tart green-apple flavors lend a tight, unyielding feel to the palate, but it's a refreshing accompaniment to creamy pasta or chicken dishes. Drink now.",84,US,New York,Riesling,16
109329,"This wine has a rustic, unclean quality. At a high alcohol level it also tastes disjointed, all about heat without fruit.",80,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
44371,"The vineyard needs a warm vintage to fully ripen, which 2010 definitely wasn't. The wine is acidic and green, with an ammonia edge to the pineapples, mangoes and limes.",85,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,15
15272,"Aromatic and refreshing, with scents of white blossoms, stonefruits and a hint of beeswax, this is fermented entirely in stainless steel and meant to be enjoyed fresh and young. Squeaky clean on the palate with hints of white peach, underripe pineapple, lime pith and a bright, lemony acidity that tickles the palate.",89,US,New York,Chardonnay,17
129487,"It's easy to see what Chef Puck is aiming for with this wine. There's a great deal of upfront citrus, tropical fruit and honey. Yet the richness fades in the finish, leading to a drier, mineral- and herb-driven balance accentuated by crisp acidity. It's food friendly, at a great price.",88,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,13
12891,"All Pepper Bridge vineyard fruit—62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah—this is right in line with the excellent 2006 Sayulita, which came from the Lefore Vineyard. Bright fruit, tart and tangy, gives a juicy, fresh quality to the mouthfeel. Lots of high-acid berry flavors, are accented by light chocolate and caramel notes from 20 months in second and third use French oak.",91,US,Washington,Red Blend,40
19959,"Dry Creek Valley is a great place to grow Syrah, and this blush wine is one of the better ones out there. It's dry, crisp in acidity and clean, with raspberry sorbet, rosehip tea and white pepper flavors. What a natural for bouillabaisse.",87,US,California,Rosé,17
57277,"Feral and smoky, this light-bodied, light-colored estate-farmed wine gives way to dark cherry, white pepper and pronounced floral elements of rose and violet. Given time in 35% new French oak, it's structured and intriguing, with a tannic punch on the finish.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,55
145168,"The name refers to a small section of vineyard planted in 1975, in the heart of a mini-banana belt in the area. It's a gorgeous looking wine, that breathes class and elegance. Well-defined cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors come to a focused middle; it's a high-wire style, still young and fresh, but certainly ageworthy. Cellar Candidate (6 – 10 years).",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,66
123048,"Aromas of pear, melted butter and toasty spice lead to a lightly creamy, elegantly styled palate with lingering stone-fruit flavors. It seems faint but what's there shows a fine sense of balance.",88,US,Washington,Chardonnay,29
38486,"A good followup to last year's vintage. It's a dry, silky Pinot Noir, with deep, earthy flavors of cherries, raspberries, liqueur, sweet oak and cinnamon spices. An upscale wine to drink now.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
136444,"That terrific Santa Rita acidity is there, and the oak regimen tastes very expensive, but the fruit doesn't seem up to the task. It's a pretty good wine, with pineapples, dates, crème brûlée and spices, but there should be greater richness and complexity from this esteemed vineyard.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,39
67834,"This is a very ripe, fruity Syrah, rich in raspberry, blueberry and cherry jam flavors, with hints of bacon and pepper. The acid-tannin balance is lovely, making the wine easy to like now.",88,US,California,Syrah,30
143116,"Smells pleasantly interesting and complex, with a delicate interplay of blackberry, oak and white pepper, but there's a letdown in the mouth. There, the wine turns sharp and acidic, although dry. Drink now.",83,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,11
105390,"The winery's Affinity bottling has had mixed results over the years, but this is one of their best, right up there with the 2007. It's a beautiful wine, absolutely dry, tannic, smooth and complex in black currant flavor. A bright streak of acidity provides wonderful balance, and should help the wine to age through at least 2019.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
42578,"With a fresh, jammy, blackberry flavor, this is a nice Syrah to drink now. It's a big wine, full bodied, tannic and bone dry. On its own, it's a bit tough, but pair it with rich, oily lamb, beef and game dishes and it will rise to the occasion.",86,US,California,Syrah,20
44134,"Note the remarkably low alcohol! Not surprisingly, this is a searingly tart wine, the acidity further emphasized by stainless steel fermentation and aging. Nonetheless, flavors are rich and deep, a lemon and grapefruit explosion that seems to demand raw oysters. Definitely a wine for acid lovers.",90,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,50
82623,"Zaca Mesa accomplishes the difficult task of creating a ripe, fruity rosé that finishes thoroughly dry. This is a minor miracle in California. It's all Grenache, which accounts for the cherry flavors, but there's a bracing minerality and fine, clean acidity.",90,US,California,Rosé,16
55437,"Soft and sweet in raspberries, cherries and anise liqueur, like a coffeehouse drink, sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,13
117683,"Finishes a little sweet, soft and simple, but the cherry and cola flavors have a richness that satisfies. Drink now.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,19
43720,"A solid Syrah from superstar winemaker Morgan. With flavors of blackberries, Provençal herbs, currants and pepper, its bone dry and balanced. The tannins are a bit rustic, and call for a nice grilled steak.",87,US,California,Syrah,20
46766,"This big-bodied wine is full of smoke, toast and custard in the nose, sure signs of barrel fermentation or aging. The mouth is packed with thick, custardy citrus fruit, which renders it a bit like orange-tinged flan. Fortunately, it retains its acids, which keeps it well balanced despite the heavy oaking it went through.",89,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,17
25978,"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine.",92,US,California,Syrah,44
18540,"Confusingly labeled as Pivot Blanc (not Pinot Blanc), this is actually a Riesling! Off dry, lightly fruity, with pleasant flavors of lemon and breakfast tea, honey and chamomile, it's best consumed young and chilled.",87,US,Washington,Riesling,14
135178,"Lots of juicy fruit and zesty acidity in this wine. It's PGs like this that are driving the variety in America. Apples, nectarines, peaches, peppery spices and wildflowers all mingle into a fruity, slightly sweet finish.",85,US,California,Pinot Grigio,14
92444,"Almost, but not quite, undrinkable, this Zin is vegetal and dry, with asparagus-tinged flavors of berries.",80,US,California,Zinfandel,11
135746,"From the pretty pale, amber color to the long, distinguished finish, this is a great rosé sparkler. To begin with, it's dry, a point in its favor, while the flavors are subtle and complex. They suggest pink grapefruits, tangerine zest, a squeeze of white peach, vanilla, and the smoke and dough of oak and lees. With its low alcohol and very low pH, it's a balanced wine of great structural integrity.",91,US,California,Sparkling Blend,26
125427,"Rich and mouth-filling, showing a bone dry, briskly tannic scour, and exuberant flavors of pepper, blackberries, currants, leather and smoke. Drink now.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,35
58152,"A light wine, this shows mostly flavors of earth, forest floor and dried wood, rather than fruit. The finish leaves a sour aftertaste.",84,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,20
16014,"This pure Cabernet jumps from the glass with luscious cherry fruit. Forward and tasty, it's a full-blown mouthful of cherries and chocolate, with a hint of warmth in the back of the throat from the alcohol. Drink soon while the fresh fruit is in play.",89,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,36
117353,"Soft and fragrant, smooth and showing a pleasing mix of citrus, berry and plum, this wine has no rough edges. It slides through the palate with the grace of a racehorse, its smooth, ripe tannins leaving a hint of black olive and fresh herb on the finish.",91,US,Washington,Syrah,40
77472,"Seared black cherries and savory hoisin umami notes mix with cinnamon, sandalwood, incense and brown spice on the nose of this bottling by Jake Knotts of the Jocko's Steakhouse family. It's lively, energetic and easy to quaff on the palate, with bright boysenberries and aromatic purple flowers, proving medium weight in body and style.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,26
79452,"Don't confuse this with the winery's regular Riesling, which is off-dry. This is their dry bottling, and it's a superior wine. Shows vital, crisp acidity that makes the mouth water, then follows up with rich citrus, green apple, Asian pear and peppery spice flavors that are tantalizing and complex. One of the more compelling dry Rieslings out there, but the 100-case production will make it hard to find.",89,US,California,Riesling,18
122409,"Dark and juicy, the tight flavors are a mix of black cherry and cassis, with a tart mouthfeel and smooth finishing tannins. Though it sees 60% new oak, the wine spends relatively little time in those barrels, and doesn't show as much oak influence as you'd suspect. A firm finish from Red Mountain tannins brings in dark chocolate, smoke and coffee grounds.",90,US,Washington,Merlot,28
109296,"A little rough around the edges, but otherwise a soft, juicy wine for drinking now. It has pleasant cherry pie and ripe red-currant fruit flavors. Air it in a decanter or in the glass for an hour before drinking.",86,US,California,Merlot,29
120898,"This is the first vintage of this designated wine, grown on a high-elevation vineyard called William Wesley, near Annapolis. Cherry, raspberry and a touch of smoke create synergy around a medium-bodied core of soft, velvety texture and a crisp seasoning of white pepper.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,62
43223,"This wine is a blend of 87% Petite Sirah and Zinfandel. The aromas of herb, graphite, barrel spice, plum and cranberry seem a bit muddled. The palate offers tart fruit flavors, with plenty of wood influence mixed in.",87,US,Washington,Red Blend,36
59635,"This is a good, dry, somewhat rugged Cabernet, rich in varietal blackberry and black currant flavors with a coating of smoky oak. It's fully ready to drink now. Shows real elegance in the refined mouthfeel, and the spicy finish is a delight.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
912,"The Daou brothers have become increasingly known for their rich, unctuous and lavish high-end wines, but this bottling offers a taste of that opulence for just $30. Plump blueberry and soft, cedar-like spice scents show on the nose, while the palate bursts with black cherry, dark chocolate and caramel flavors, powered by ample acidity. It will age gracefully, but is already delicious.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,30
72008,"This is a pretty Pinot that's light and silky on the palate, and comforting in its moderate alcohol and spicy, exotic flavors. It offers waves of wild forest berry pie, baking spice, sweet-and-sour persimmon and sandalwood flavors that are intriguingly complex. Absolutely delightful now.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,49
103958,"Light and nutty, this combines a majority of Grenache with Zinfandel, Mourvèdre and Tempranillo. Fermented in stainless steel tanks, it maintains fresh acidity with its lightly ripe strawberry and watermelon fruit.",87,US,California,Rosé,21
22239,"This Sancerre-like effort shows amazing concentration and distinct, vineyard-driven flavors of grain and herb. Racy, textural, crisp and penetrating, it's lifted by a refreshing minerality. Lemon polish, citrus oil, a very delicate suggestion of honey in the nose and mouth, and above all a wonderful persistence make this a standout Sauvignon Blanc.",93,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,26
35520,"A worthy followup to the 2007, perhaps not as immediately flamboyant, but a major Pinot Noir to age in the cellar. Shows flashy cherry and raspberry fruit, with tantalizingly rich spices and a perfect coating of sweet, smoky oak. Fine and delicious now, after decanting, and should develop over this decade.",94,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
2623,"Soft and sweet, with canned apricot and syrupy peach flavors.",82,US,California,Pinot Grigio,10
75116,"Herbal and peppery, with a brambly character to the cranberry/raspberry fruit, this seems to be hiding the influence of aging in 25% new French oak. Extra time in the bottle could bump up the score.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,35
100883,"Not much going on in this flat, candy-sweet wine. It tastes like the liquid in canned peaches and pineapples.",82,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
75271,"Once again the Jerome Reserve delivers the goods—a fine core of ripe cherry fruit, wrapped in pretty new oak. It's full-bodied, round and textural, while retaining a crisp, well-defined focus. Barrel aging adds complexity, with streaks of coffee, licorice and dark chocolate.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
113826,"This has good, clean, ripe fruit with some mass and muscle, and the flavors go deep rather than broad. Berry, currant and cherry are in the mix, with polished tannins and finishing threads of coffee and chocolate. Nothing shy here, but delicious.",90,US,Washington,Red Blend,50
28332,"A tannic blend of Montepulciano, Sangiovese, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is closed in the nose and dense in texture.",82,US,California,Red Blend,35
16594,"Extravagantly rich in tropical fruit, orange, honey and sweet oak flavors, this is balanced, with crisp acidity and a dry finish. It's a good example of the popular style, at the upper tier.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,64
95706,"A lovely drink from a winery in Massachusetts where all they produce is apple ice wine. One sip and you're instantly transported to standing in an orchard on a brisk fall afternoon, with forward aromas and flavors of baked apples with soft spice, caramel and tangerine citrus. Full in the mouth with moderate acidity and a crisp, clean finish.",89,US,Massachusetts,Apple,25
114130,"Bitter oak, a sugary mouthfeel, and an earthy, chunky, pineapple candy-flavored palate.",83,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,10
15531,"Very rich, ripe and bold, in the way of Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noirs, with mouth filling cherry, raspberry, red plum and mocha flavors, enhanced with smoky oak. Tasty, but a bit ponderous, with some sharpness through the finish. Try cellaring for 4–5 years and see where it goes.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,80
79587,"A savory, lightly herbal character complements raspberry and cherry flavors in this medium-bodied and well-balanced wine. It has light tannins for a little grip in the texture, and attractive complexity from the aroma to the finish.",89,US,California,Red Blend,28
641,"Completely stainless-fermented and aged, this is a blockbuster of a white wine, refreshing and exotic in floral intoxication. Dry and light-bodied, it offers an edginess of slate-like minerality along with aromas of apricot and peach, finishing in a dusting of white pepper.",92,US,California,Pinot Gris,25
77463,"Buoyant and blossomy, this semidry Riesling bursts of fresh apple and grapefruit flavors and a distinctly floral perfume. A tart lime edge frames a brisk, clean finish. Drink now to appreciate its freshness and aroma.",89,US,New York,Riesling,14
59169,"Lychee and mango aromas waft from this delicate wine. Off-dry in style, it's unusually brisk on the palate with crisp stone-fruit flavors and bright tangerine acidity. It closes with a lacy sweetness.",87,US,New York,Gewürztraminer,22
95779,"This is a particularly fine vintage for the popular Dr. Wolfe's, maintaining the customary blend of Primitivo, Lemberger and Petite Sirah. Dark and smoky, with dense flavors of berry, cassis, licorice and dark chocolate, it is far more substantial than most red blends in this price range.",90,US,Washington,Red Blend,15
2346,"Mike Sinor's pet-nat experiment scored big in 2016. This pink sparkler offers complex yeasty bread, crushed rock and turned clay aromas. Zingy and racy, it grabs hold of the palate. It's all about fascinating texture and refreshing acidity.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,25
28946,"A deep color and oodles of blackberry and boysenberry flavors lend a lot of impact to this full-bodied, ripe and almost jammy-tasting wine. It is generous, layered and concentrated but not overly serious in terms of tannins. Call it big but friendly.",90,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,36
140291,"Malbec and Petit Verdot are the other two grapes in this juicy, toasty blend. There's plenty of black cherry fruit, and equally generous flavors of mocha and toast, all wrapped together around ripe, slightly grainy tannins.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
74800,"An average, slightly raw Syrah, with edgy tannins that finish with a bit of a scowl. Packed inside are blackberry, currant, cocoa, pepper and herb flavors.",83,US,California,Syrah,18
92306,"This is a soft, approachable juicy and unfussy wine, wrapped in sturdy stalks of oak and showy tannin. It offers a value-minded taste of blackberry jam and leather.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
85518,"A fine single-vineyard Syrah, aromatic with seductive scents of berry and earth, accented with toast and set up in the mouth with firm tannins. It's an elegant take on Syrah, very pretty, juicy and tart. More bottle time is a good idea before drinking, or decant it for several hours to smooth it out further.",90,US,Washington,Syrah,35
55010,"This easy-drinking wine is full of fruit in the aromas and flavors and has a smooth, non-tannic texture and full body. Its concentrated raspberry and red cherry aromas are followed by ripe plum and cherry flavors, with juicy acidity.",89,US,California,Barbera,29
13249,"This is off-dry to sweet, with honey, orange and vanilla flavors with a touch of petrol.",84,US,California,Riesling,14
25550,"Lush cassis aromas are cut by black pepper and charcoal on the nose of this bottling by Las Vegas sommelier-turned-winemaker Paolo Barbieri, who was raised in Rome. It's still young and tightly wound on the palate, but slowly unfurls boisterous blackberry fruit, thyme and pepper, with sticky firm tannins and a strong acidity from front to back.",92,US,California,Syrah,46
127265,"Hot blueberry paste, fudge and wet gravel make for an in-your-face nose on this bottling of a three-acre block of the Valley View Vineyard by regional growing pioneer Louis Lucas and retired Judge Royce Lewellen. The palate shows black cherry laced with espresso and black-rock minerality, and an ageable acidity. It could be a cellar classic, but it's tasty right now.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,48
82063,"The Grand Vin from Water's Crest hits the nose with intense aromas of char, smoke and dark cherries, but is laced with a veil of green, vegetal notes throughout. On the palate, flavors of black coffee and rich black fruit are followed by a sweet vanilla chaser. Sturdy but supple tannins add structure and bite.",85,US,New York,Merlot,25
8108,"Vivacious on the nose, with hibiscus flowers, pomegranate, strawberry, rose petal and cola aromas, this bottling from a historic vineyard is both juicy and delicate at the same time. Vibrant flavors of cranberry, pomegranate, hibiscus and even red melon show on the palate, enhanced by dried fennel, sage and purple flowers.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,65
106887,"The vineyard is in a warm, inland section of Mendocino County, and the wine is ripe to the point of super-mature. It lacks the acidity for vibrancy, while the blackberry, coffee and chocolate flavors are Porty and off-dry.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,35
8052,"A boisterous, easy-drinking red wine that gushes ripe fruit and sweet oak aromas. It tastes almost sweet, like blackberry jam, and seems soft-textured in spite of its full body.",86,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,31
137819,"Clean and fresh, this food-friendly wine tastes of pear, jicama and celery. It's light and balanced, and would make a fine accompaniment to a springtime salad or a simple fish course.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,16
79321,"One of the winery's sweeter wines, this Pinot Noir-based bubbly has jammy raspberry, strawberry and vanilla flavors. Ultra-crisp acidity provides needed balance. It's a little heavy, but will appeal to those who want some sugar in their sparkling wine.",87,US,California,Sparkling Blend,33
12983,"This opens with a strong sense of coconut that abruptly hits pomegranate and cranberry on the palate. The sweetness of the coconut dissipates on the finish, which veers slightly sour.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
52293,"This is the second label for Col Solare, the Ste. Michelle/Antinori collaboration on Red Mountain. A fine bottle for the price, it shows the same elegance and supple texture as the frontline wine. Black cherry, blueberry, mocha and smoke swirl over and around the palate. Only in the finish does it seem to fade quickly, with a very slight suggestion of glue in the aftertaste.",88,US,Washington,Red Blend,45
91348,"A wonderful wine, one of the best Petite Verdots in California, although the truth is there aren't all that many. It's sturdy in tannins and richly textured, with delicious blackberry flavors that are a little earthier and drier than Cabernet Sauvignon.",92,US,California,Petite Verdot,35
58544,"A rich, fruity wine with explosive blackberry and cherry jam, black currant, spicy plum and smoky cedar flavors. Direct and obvious now, but could develop bottle complexity over the next 4–6 years.",87,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,40
22545,"From Long Shadows, a rare, barrel-fermented Riesling. Sappy, tart, juicy and stylish, this is loaded with pear, grapefruit and Meyer lemon. The acidity is generous but softened up a bit by the extra oxygen from the fuder.",91,US,Washington,Riesling,25
48646,"This estate-grown Pinot Gris has a pleasing delicacy, balancing light citrus with whiffs of pine and a base of pear and cucumber. Just 13% alcohol, it might strike some tasters as a little thin, but it would make a fine accompaniment to a course of soft, creamy cheeses.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,15
117861,"Another fabulous I Block from Mondavi. Exceptionally ripe in grapefruit, lime and gooseberry fruit, it shows the minerality of this vineyard that gives the wine grip and grounding. Bone-dry, with crisp supportive acidity and just the right amount of oak, it's wonderful now. This is not a wine to age, but will hold over the next four years.",93,US,California,Fumé Blanc,75
138250,"Made from Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc, this Mendocino-Lodi-Clarksburg blend is a little too sweet for comfort. There's a sugary edge to the apricot, peach and vanilla flavors that makes it not really a dry table wine. But racy acidity gives it an extra point.",83,US,California,White Blend,11
24963,"A rich wine that flatters the palate with flashy berry, cherry cocoa and oak flavors. Andrew Murray has been one of the Central Coast's true Rhône variety pioneers.",88,US,California,G-S-M,30
47121,"A disagreeable Rhône-style blend, soft, sweet and unripe, with gentle tannins.",81,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,24
116481,"This wine captures the popular grapefruity, grassy style of the variety in a crisp, refreshing and flavorful way. Light to medium bodied and full of bracing acidity, it will be great with seafood or as a pre-dinner drink.",88,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,16
97096,"Base notes of vanilla, peach and honeysuckle linger on the nose as honeydew and chamomile show in the background. Tangerine, honeysuckle, peach, honeydew and ginger show on the rich palate, with a zip of acidity o the long, tingly finish.",88,US,Virginia,Viognier,24
90788,"Good acidity on this clean, vibrant wine, with interesting pineapple, orange, pear and honeysuckle flavors. If you like your wines a little sweet, try it as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Gris.",87,US,California,Grenache Blanc,20
145904,"Here's a raspingly tannic, high-acid wine that feels astringently dry at first. Then the cherry flavors kick in, and all sorts of complexing herbs, spices and oak influences. It's an interesting red, but those tannins and acids call for something rich and Italian, like chicken cacciatore.",89,US,California,Sangiovese,24
58814,"A good effort at this price, this tart and tasty Pinot mixes cranberry and sour cherry fruit with plenty of juicy acidity. Ten percent was aged in new French oak, and you can pick up just a lick of chocolate as the finish fades.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,15
59432,"This Merlot over-delivers for the everyday price. It's bone dry and classically structured, with rich, ripe tannins and mouthwatering acidity framing flavors of cherries, red and black currants, dusty spices and cedar. Sommeliers, scoop this one up. More than 15,000 cases produced.",87,US,California,Merlot,11
79674,"A nose of clean citrus and spice leads on this simple but likeable Chardonnay. On the palate, it offers more of the fresh flavors and the finish is crisp. A nice wine with seafood and salad, and a good choice for fans of lively whites.",83,US,New York,Chardonnay,20
79700,"This wine combines green, herbal overtones with puckering, bitter tannins, a unsavory mix that doesn't please the palate.",82,US,California,Merlot,44
39964,"There's a lovely sweetness to the fruit, which tastes like ripe, just-picked blackberries. Old vines, 100+ years, deliver sweet, supple, sexy fruit. The wine has very dry tannins, and it might profit from some blending, but with a vineyard this special you have to admire the single-vineyard approach.",93,US,California,Zinfandel,28
4056,"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this rosé has a weightiness. It's juicy, bold and dry, with a hue of freshly cut watermelon that follows on the palate, alongside dried cranberry and currant.",87,US,California,Rosé,20
43865,"From this always dependable producer comes this lovely, supple wine. There are plenty of bright, ripe raspberry, black-cherry and cola flavors nuanced by smoke and spice notes from oak. If it’s not terribly complex, it more than makes up for it with the liveliness of the acids, the balance and the silky harmony.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,22
28968,"This is a blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, and all of the fruit came from old vines from two of Washington's most revered vineyards, Champoux and Weinbau. Supple and ripe, it's packed with a brilliant, flavorful mix of berries, cherries and cassis. The tannins are polished, and the barrel-derived notes of toast, cinnamon, coffee and caramel linger through the long, smooth finish.",96,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,65
9955,"A solid deal for the price, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc presents aromas of pine forest, damp caves and black cherry. The blueberry juice flavors fade fast, leaving black sage on the finish. The tannins are ready to drink now.",87,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,20
117162,"A bit on the sugary sweet side, but otherwise this is a nice cocktail sipper. Shows good acidity coupled with pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and spice flavors. Would score much higher if it were drier.",85,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
98901,"Superripe in blackberry, red plum, cherry, mocha, fig and caramel flavors, this wine certainly scores high on the deliciousness factor. It could use greater structural depth and complexity but is good overall.",87,US,California,Syrah,32
100624,"This is the first Easton Pinot Noir ever reviewed in this magazine, and it's a promising start for the winery, which is known for Zinfandel. Shows Pinot's dryness and silky texture, and proper flavors of raspberries, red currants, cola, spices and cedar. The next step, if Easton is ambitious, is to build in complexity.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,25
25272,"Made from 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir, this is a young, light sparkler with developed flavors of honey, lychee and apple. The body is crisp and medium in weight, and it finishes tart in lemon.",87,US,California,Sparkling Blend,25
50083,"The oak (40% new French and American) is up front, with aromas of barrel spices, cocoa and generous amounts of vanilla followed by cherries and blue fruit. This wine is velvety in feel, displaying a mixture of fruit and barrel that carries through the finish. The oak influence is heavy but the appeal is impossible to ignore.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
49213,"The Cherryblock Cabs seem to share a common minty characteristic that's particularly noticeable in this vintage. There's also a decent amount of cassis, earth and tobacco, and the finish remains firmly tannic. Drink or hold.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,120
6934,"This winery is at the extreme edge of the pick-early, low-alcohol movement, which can make the wines challenging for the usual California Pinot fan. But this Pinot begins on familar territory, with heady aromas of dried violet and scarlet rose, damp forest floor, and cinnamon-laced cranberry sauce, managing to be both brisk and funky. The flavors are light and tart, but will pick up more savory characteristics from 2018–2024.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,70
82200,"This is Swanson's top Cabernet, which includes a splash of Merlot. As always, it's rich, tannic and dry, and it possesses a deep core of blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems more tannic and sharp than in previous vintages, which suggests its ageability. Try holding it until 2015.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
41383,"A little green and minty, with some stalky flavors, but dry and vibrant in acidity. Offers good cherry and raspberry pie flavors that are wrapped into a silky texture, with beautiful tannins. Drink now.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
80803,"Oaky and ripe, this Chardonnay shows soft flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, mangoes and sweetly smoked vanilla oak. Made in the modern style for drinking now.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,40
118047,"This is Duckhorn's signature vineyard for Merlot, located off the Silverado Trail below Calistoga. It's also the winery's most variable Merlot, showing distinct vintage variation. The 2004 was a warm vintage, and the wine is soft and voluptuous in pie-filling cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But it doesn't have the tough tannins that cooler vintages show.",88,US,California,Merlot,85
53679,"A simple, easy Cabernet, rich in black currant, chocolate and oak flavors, and wrapped into thick, soft tannins. Drink now.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
123506,"This wine comes from the original, own-rooted, 1965 plantings. It would be interesting to trace the ancestry of these vines, as such things were far less understood 50 years ago. Soft, round and fruity, this offers pleasant flavors of melon and apple. A dash of vanilla cookie coming through as it finishes.",86,US,Oregon,Pinot Blanc,22
33352,"Insanely rich and opulent, brimming with apricot and tangerine jam, green-apple butter, pineapple tart, vanilla, honeysuckle, buttered toast and spice flavors. Somehow, the mass is reined in by a tight framework of acids, minerals and oak tannins. This shows the pedigree that comes from this famous vineyard, as well as the Williams Selyem signature of extreme class and deliciousness. Drink over the next five years.",94,US,California,Chardonnay,55
59782,"Delectable notes of pastry spice, blackberry and vanilla unfurl onto the medium-bodied palate, which is bolstered by sinewy tannins and finessed acids.",87,US,Virginia,Cabernet Sauvignon,18
131210,"Geyser Peak's Reserve Chards have been pretty good lately, as they learn how to bring balance to grapes that ripen so easily. The '05 is plenty ripe, packed with jammy apricot, tangerine and oaky vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. It's a rich, exotic wine, with good enough acidity for balance.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,23
135525,"Kirby Anderson, Gainey's longtime winemaker, has crafted this wonderfully rich, vibrant and expressive wine. Partially barrel fermented, but with no new oak, it has a creamy texture framing ripe flavors of apricots, peaches, lemons, limes and grapes. Drink it now for its youthful exuberance.",92,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
90108,"True to the ambitious Damiani style, this wine has tightly packed fruit tones with a generous overlay of vanilla and mocha from toasty new oak. Intoxicating flavors of caramelized pineapple and boysenberry frame the dense palate while refined tannins provide a counterbalance to the dense fruit. The finish is moderately long and slightly drying, winding up with a chocolate note. Best 2011–2013.",88,US,New York,Meritage,27
81903,"From the winery's Phinny Hill vineyard, the Columbia Rediviva is 48% Cabernet Sauvignon and 52% Syrah. Complex and satiny, it's a riveting wine, inky and bursting with a sensuous mix of berry, cassis, mocha, loam, cinnamon and spice. Tremendous density and depth; despite its youth the wine curls around the tongue like thick smoke, showing more and more detail.",96,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,48
50711,"This estate-grown wine is tart and tangy, with a backbone of enviable structure. Orange citrus adds an illusion of heightened acidity that balances the burly tannins that give strength and power. Red cherry and pomegranate round out savory clove and black tea on the way to an earthy finish. Drink now through 2023.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
62457,"Like a nice German kabinett. There's lots of fresh, clean acidity framing off-dry peach, citrus and spice flavors.",83,US,California,Riesling,12
96749,"Lemony and toasty, this approachable wine is rich and balanced, its texture soft and the flavors long-lasting, highlighted by a taste of lemon meringue.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,25
99805,"Lush and full-bodied layers of velvety texture support firm flavors of baked cherry, pomegranate, pine forest and earth, a vibrant current of acidity bursting beneath. Layers of tannin provide a hearty mouthfeel and sense of density, signaling a robust vintage.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
137539,"This meaty, substantial wine was barrel fermented in neutral oak and hints at oxidation, particularly in terms of its dusty, tawny color. Clocking in at 14.9% alcohol, it definitely shows some heat on the finish. But it's a full-bodied style with immediate appeal, lush with candied fruit flavors, streaks of butter and toasted nuts. Its weight and mouthfeel are very much like a ripe Chardonnay, but with added perfume and precision.",88,US,Washington,Viognier,18
64372,"Feels gritty and rough, with a disagreeable mouthfeel that seems to make the cherry-berry fruit taste sweeter and tarter than it really is. There's also lots of sweetly smoked oak. Could just be being difficult now, but doesn't seem likely to improve.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
81630,"Sourced from the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley, just two barrels were made of this wine. It's smooth, rich and elegant—a mix of pineapple and citrus—with light hints of coconut and toast. There's good concentration in the finish, heightened with citrus rind phenolics.",92,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,60
63548,"Nicely dry and crisp in clean acidity, this Sauvignon Blanc has flavors of limes, gooseberries, and vanilla. But there's a lot of that notorious feline spray aroma and taste that detracts.",83,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,14
122874,"A blend of fruit from Woodward Canyon and Celilo vineyards, subtle aromas of pear, apple and toast lead to elegant well-balanced fruit flavors, brightened by tart acidity. The balance is exquisite. Apple flavors persist on the finish.",91,US,Washington,Chardonnay,44
44246,"A great follow-up to the winery's 2008, this continues a roll of classy Diamond Mountain-based Cabs from Wallis Family. It's dry, softly tannic and likeable for its depth of blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors. This straddles the line between immediate drinkability and ageability.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
8252,"Crunchy fresh pears and white grapefruit abound in this pert fruity Pinot Grigio. Despite its light body, it's expansive and silken on the palate, finishing on a crisp lemon-drop tone. Drink now through 2019 to maximize its fresh appeal.",89,US,New York,Pinot Grigio,16
62185,"Aromas of birthday cake, fig, tobacco, soy and shitake take this lead on this blend that seems advanced. Flavors are tart and silky, with slightly gritty tannins. Drink now.",86,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,40
89140,"This is a nice, likeable Cabernet made for drinking now. It shows fancy Napa tannins and ripe, sweet flavors of blackberries, red cherries, licorice and sandalwood that are intense and concentrated in the way of mountain fruit. Lovely and easy, it will develop bottle complexity over the next 2–3 years.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,59
48925,"Rich and delicious, although it's also somewhat soft and direct. Offers upfront, jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries, with elaborate oak touches of toast, vanilla and caramel. Drink now.",86,US,California,Tempranillo,25
20389,"Thin fruit, with a canned pea scent and a hint of the veggies.",85,US,Idaho,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
83005,"This Cabernet-Merlot blend is packed with blackberry and crème de cassis, with a firm minerality. With the weight of the middle palate and the long, spicy finish, it's especially attractive, although it's also quite tannic. The only difference between this Estate Monte Bello Cabernet and Ridge's Monte Bello Estate Cabernet ($150; note the difference in the placement of ""estate"") is that the winemaker selected lots from the vineyard that were considered more accessible, which in this case means more luscious. Despite its many charms, the wine should age for a long time.",95,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
134032,"Nicholas Cole Cellars is the winery, and the grapes in this Bordeaux blend are essentially all estate, except for a little Canoe Ridge Merlot. This is substantial, herbal, with plenty of juicy red fruit and a leafy, earthy sub-text. Dark, exotic, tangy and still youthfully sharp, this needs breathing time to soften up and open out.",89,US,Washington,Red Blend,25
126012,"The wine is 100% varietal, very fresh, and loaded with lime and citrus and citrus rind—a real oyster and shellfish wine. There is discernible minerality, plenty of acid, and alcohol just touching 13%.",88,US,Washington,Viognier,20
51756,"As in 2009, the 2010 Bully includes 10% Petit Verdot, and was aged in 100% new French oak. Muscular tannins and hints of caraway speak to the substantial addition of PV, and the wine is at first chewy and closed. Give it aerating and it shows plenty of depth, with dense raspberry fruit, notes of white pepper and crushed rock, and a lively streak of lemony acid.",93,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
94684,"This light-bodied Rhône-style blend is mostly Grenache and Mourvèdre. It's simple and easy to drink, with flavors of raspberries, cherries and spices. Give it a bit of a chill and pair it with a hamburger.",85,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,22
38125,"A mix of estate-grown and sourced (from the Rogue valley) grapes, this Oregon Merlot has black cherry and chocolate at its core, but quickly thins out, with very tart acidity. It's got its own style, with stiff tannins, the leaf and stem notes subdued, and a fine balance. But it will show best with food, especially steak.",87,US,Oregon,Merlot,20
128337,"Take two somewhat obscure, often-overlooked grapes, make a 50-50 blend, and voila—magic. Peppery, fruity, grapey, loaded with berries and dotted with spice, this delicious bottle has “summer” written all over it. Pour it at any barbecue and wait for the applause.",88,US,Washington,Grenache-Carignan,22
67443,"Here is a powerful young wine with concentrated plum and cherry fruit. It's beautifully built around perfectly ripened tannins that provide solid support without being intrusive. Compact and well proportioned, it lingers with highlights of espresso grounds, dark chocolate and black tea.",94,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,60
59244,"A little soft in acidity, a little sweet in sugary flavor, this Sangiovese has cherry, tobacco, licorice and vanilla-spice flavors that are wrapped in silky tannins.",83,US,California,Sangiovese,35
89073,"Reserve is an unregulated term, so it is unclear what this means at Silvan Ridge. This is a thin, herbal and noticeably earthy wine. There is little in the way of fruit or varietal specificity. But it's perfectly quaffable.",83,US,Oregon,Merlot,19
49998,"An elegant Viognier, this first release from a young Lake Chelan vineyard has unusual delicacy for this often-bitter grape. At a moderate 13% alcohol, it shows lemon and lime rind, pink grapefruit and just a hint of white peach flavors. It finishes dry, and despite its lightness, it has a nice grip and persistence through the finish as well as firm acidity. Could be a gem with fresh oysters.",88,US,Washington,Viognier,19
49377,"Floral aromas and flavors mingle in a sweet, slightly soapy midpalate. The fruit is nondescript; what is most noticeable are the brown, sweet spices.",85,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,29
47452,"A glorious wine. Based on Merlot, with nearly equal parts of the two Cabernets, it's softly smooth and delicious right now. Totally bone dry, yet rich and sweet in cherries, berries, chocolate and cedar, it satisfies on every level. Expensive, yes, but a relative bargain for a great Napa wine.",94,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,50
45177,"A polished, elegant Merlot, with good structure framing deep flavors of currants, carob, violets and anise. The thick tannins suggest a good steak. Now through 2009.",90,US,California,Merlot,38
57299,"This is 100% Cabernet, with the purity that is a recurring hallmark of Rulo's wines. A deep, and deeply satisfying fruit expression, lifted with juicy acidity, brings a mélange of berries, cassis and black cherries into play. The grace notes pile on—smoke, black olive, tar, tobacco leaf, bitter chocolate. Young, bracing, and built to age.",93,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
21820,"Watery and sweet, like fruit juice, with orange, pineapple and buttered toast flavors.",82,US,California,Chardonnay,13
94111,"Locked down by hard tannins, this nonetheless is a beautiful Zinfandel, dry and rich in flavor. It bursts with savory wild berry, tobacco, mocha and pepper flavors, and feels elegant and refined. The tannins call for enormously rich beef, pasta, sauces and cheeses.",92,US,California,Zinfandel,35
105919,"Vibrant and youthful, this wine greets the taster with fresh, clean scents of honey, fall flowers and roses. It's medium-bodied and crisp, with a final peach note that fades a bit too quickly. Try with Thai curry. No improvement with age; drink before 2011.",83,US,New York,Gewürztraminer,18
28611,"All Cabernet from Champoux, Klipsun, Palengat and Wallula vineyards, this wine offers aromas of blackberry, incense, blueberry, pencil lead and barrel spices. On the palate, it's tightly wound with black fruit flavors and a firm backbone of tannins. The oak is primary right now. It needs extended time in the cellar to show itself fully, and will be best from 2022–2030.",95,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,140
67322,"Shows the dry, lightly elegant mouthfeel that a pure Cab Franc should have, with polished cherry and vanilla flavors. But it struggles to rise beyond country-style.",85,US,California,Cabernet Franc,22
45116,"An appealing quaffer with notes of passion fruit, papaya and citrus. It drinks a hair off dry (1.2g/L residual sugar), with moderate concentration, and goes down easy.",85,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,10
64425,"Intensely herbaceous with a woody characteristic and touch of green olive, this estate-grown wine offers tight-grained tannins and a lift of acidity around deeper notes of cassis and chocolate. From a vineyard in St. Helena, it shows the relative coolness of the vintage.",90,US,California,Cabernet Franc,48
35883,"Strong, caramelized oak stars in this dry, rather one-dimensional Cabernet. Despite some black currant, anise and mocha flavors, it's like drinking toothpicks.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
56009,"This is a lighter Schindler than in the past, reflecting the difficult, rain-soaked 2007 vintage. But it shows the character of the vineyard, with subtle hints of blood, rock and herb providing the foundation below the tangy, spicy and tart red fruits. Great winemakers make good wines in even the most difficult vintages; this is the proof.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,42
70873,"A bit on the weedy, sharp side, with some prickly acids. Has just enough peaches and cream flavor to satisfy Chard lovers.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,16
3176,"Distinctive in aroma and flavor profile, this medium-bodied red smells like cedar, tobacco and black pepper. A blend of Mourvèdre, Montepulciano and Barbera, it boasts an earthy personality that is appealing and unique. Fifteen percent of the proceeds from the sale of this wine are contributed to the Return To Freedom Wild Horse Sanctuary.",90,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,25
6457,"Sourced from a small vineyard in the The Rocks of Walla Walla, this shows classic, terroir-driven umami flavors. It's as if the fruit were soaked in seaweed, then lifted on a platform of rock. It has lovely aromatics, with a rather delicate finish that's nuanced with cherry and tar.",91,US,Washington,Syrah,60
53840,"Extraordinarily rich, offering massive blackberry and cherry jam, red currant, licorice, balsam, bitter chocolate and red pepper flavors. It's very tannic, but seems overly soft, and probably best now, so drink up.",90,US,California,Syrah,98
101059,"Simple and direct, with minty flavors of blackberries, licorice, cola, peppercorns and vanilla. On the plus side, the wine is fully dry, the tannins smooth.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,8
72338,"A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality. It cleanses and tickles the palate, lingering sensuously through a finish of surprising depth.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Blanc,29
122162,"Crisp acidity saves this rather sweet, oaky wine by giving it a clean mouthfeel. The flavors are of pineapple and apple juice, honey and vanilla caramel.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,17
11079,"Simple fruit and a sweet, almost candied flavor. This wine seems unbalanced. There's an odd hole in the middle, and very little weight or tannin in the finish. It's all forward, sweet fruit, more like candy than berries.",82,US,California,Zinfandel,12
141199,"Very ripe, in the manner of this spectacular vintage, showing a blast of cherry pie filling, black raspberry tart, cola and smoky oak flavors. The acidity is firm and clean. Feels juvenile, with a jamminess that a few years in the cellar should resolve.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,54
44379,"A good bistro-style wine. With rustic flavors of berries, currants and tobacco and a clean, spicy finish, it's a wine to drink with anything calling for a dry, tannic red.",85,US,California,Red Blend,14
41628,"Excellent winemaking by Mike Januik, as with all these Novelty Hill wines, keeps the fruit, acid and tannins all in perfect proportion. The flavors mix blackberry and black cherry; and this young wine is still firm and wound tight.",89,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
106154,"Pretty with aromatics of rose petals, this layered, complex wine offers restrained power and demure fruit. In taste, it's a mix of black cherries and that cola-like allspice that is prevalent in many Russian River Valley sites. The mouthfeel is round and soft, with just the right tension between tannin and acidity, with a protracted finish of toasty oak.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,58
85410,"This delicious wine is as soft, silky and supple as can be. The fruit is slathered in spicy, chocolaty oak, which lends some sharpness to the edges. Red berries and red licorice lead into finishing flavors of baking chocolate. But as tasty as it is when first opened, it fades quickly, suggesting that this is one to drink up rather than lay down.",89,US,Washington,Merlot,20
89285,"While the concentrated flavors of peaches and sweet pears are pleasant, whiffs of smoke and toasted nuts lend a savory, rather atypical character to this dry Gewürz. It's dry and brisk, with soft, lemony acidity.",84,US,New York,Gewürztraminer,13
133495,"Though fruit-driven, forward and accessible, this surprises with the chewy density of its midpalate, and the depth and texture of the finish. It begins with somewhat sweet with candy flavors of raspberries, red currants and Bing cherries. Then it opens up, adding moist earth, minerals, flint and wisps of chocolaty smoke. Firm acidity and a balanced structure complete this classically proportioned and well-defined wine. An amazing 51,000 cases were made.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,20
40407,"The later disgorging of this wine made from 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay has given it a complexity of texture and flavor that's compelling, an older golden-apple and dried apricot sensibility that's intriguing on the nose and palate. Sizzling acidity makes for a crisp, dry wine, with lengthy finish.",93,US,California,Sparkling Blend,40
113442,"A little raw around the edges, lacking the sexy lushness you want in a fine Pinot Noir. Mostly that's a function of high acidity and a touch of minty green. Still, it's a delicious, complex wine, with oaky flavors of raspberries, cherries and Asian spices. Probably best now and for the next five years.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
30434,"Light fruit flavors combine watermelon and strawberry, accented with charred, astringent tannins. A tobacco flavor threads on through the finish, with a slightly chalky mouthfeel.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,28
50408,"For this new offering from the winery, fruit comes from top vineyards Dineen, StoneTree, Klipsun, Pepper Bridge, Discovery and Kiona. It displays strong aromas of burnt coffee, woodspice and cherry. Flavors are medium bodied with blocky tannins and mouthwatering acids.",88,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,30
20237,"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas intertwine with cranberry, black licorice, herb and dark fruit on a wine with a very distinctive aromatic profile. The cranberry and cherry flavors are quite soft for the variety, seeming a touch dried out at times but showing a pleasing sense of balance.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,38
85953,"Grassy, herbaceous tones are a tad pungent, but they add freshness to this lusciously textured, easy-drinking Gewürz. It's off-dry, with loads of fleshy yellow peach, pineapple and melon flavors, with delicate tangerine-juice acidity. Drink now.",86,US,New York,Gewürztraminer,13
85434,"This is a polished, really likeable Chard. It offers everything the variety should: a rich, creamy texture, brisk acidity, and ripe, delicious flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and kiwis coated with vanilla.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,27
73815,"The wine is pale in color and very light in body, neither of which is a bad thing. You want some delicacy in a Pinot Noir. The drawback is in a candied simplicity to the flavors, which are of Lifesaver cherries and raspberries.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
76715,"This lush, smooth and supple Cabernet is drinkable now for its rich array of red berry fruit, briary spice, red licorice, blond tobacco and sandalwood flavors. It shows the softness of Alexander Valley Cabernet, but make no mistake, the balance enables it to age 6–8 years.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,38
42179,"Light aromas of candle wax, kiwi and citrus lead to diluted fruit flavors. It lacks a sense of cohesion or variety.",82,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,16
51477,"The wine is always a blend of the winery's best vineyards in the northern, warm section of the valley, including Allen, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem's Estate. The 2012 is dry, tannic, delicately structured and mouthwateringly tart, with cranberry, raspberry, cherry, sandalwood and dried herb flavors. Enjoy it now and through 2018.",94,US,California,Pinot Noir,69
20452,"Light and tart, this simple and fruity style has hard candy flavors of sour cherry and raspberry. A fun wine, straightforward and good for chilling.",85,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,29
79837,"With production of more than 51,000 cases, this Cabernet will wash down lots of steaks and burgers. It's softly tannic in the mouth, with easy flavors of blackberry tea and oak.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,23
123229,"Rhubarb, cranberry and strawberry mix on the nose in this richly inviting wine that is textured and not overwhelming in weight. Featuring electric acidity, the wine finishes boldly in blackberry and licorice.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
107233,"A bit too strong in pyrazines, those notoriously green, feline aromas and tastes. Otherwise, the wine is crisp and pleasant in spearmint and citrus flavors.",83,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
135379,"This is a big, strong, fruity, oaky wine that's not showing much subtlety now. It floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, plums, spices and sweet, smoky oak, and the tannins are intricately soft and gentle. Will it develop in the bottle? No guarantees.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,70
116870,"Not yielding much now beyond hard tannins and primary fruit flavors of black currants that verge on raisins. But then, it's Petite Sirah, a known ager, and the acid-tannin balance suggests just that. Give it until 2012, at least.",88,US,California,Petite Sirah,24
61409,"Generous in aromas of leather and chocolate-covered fig, this wine gets mushy in the middle. Thin with an earthy edge and a finish that's slightly herbal.",83,US,California,Zinfandel,24
1989,"This is serviceable but rather bland, with a dusting of cinnamon spice and simple, tart fruit.",85,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,16
12253,"An interesting wine, not without problems. Pours intensely dark, and opens with aromas ranging from blackberries to  earth and white pepper. In the mouth, straddles the ripeness line, with deliciously fruity flavors kept in check by an herbal edge. A blend of Paso Robles, Edna Valley and Santa Ynez Valley.",90,US,California,Syrah,19
42667,"About as rich and flamboyant as California Chardonnay gets, a wine that blows you away with sheer pyrotechnic wizardry. Massive in grilled pineapples, mangoes, Key lime pie, vanilla honey, crème caramel and dusty spices, accented with perfect acidity.",95,US,California,Chardonnay,30
68983,"A sleek blend of wet-cement minerality, slight dairy notes, citrus pith and a grapefruit spritz freshness makes for a very inviting nose on this wine from a new vineyard that overlooks the Santa Ynez River. A rocky, grassy element powers the palate, with lime zest and chopped Granny Smith apple-peel flavors.",91,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,48
87756,"In this appellation blend from the single-vineyard-focused Los Gatos winery, aromas of cherry and chaparral scrub are pleasant if reluctant to emerge. The palate laces tart pomegranate and cranberry with licorice and forest-floor elements.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
78061,"A streak of sharp acidity and green mint makes this wine too tart, despite some pleasant cherry, red currant, clove and cola flavors. The wine is unlikely to develop additional bottle complexity. Sourced from the Sanford & Benedict and La Rinconada vineyards.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,34
98686,"Strong-minded with a tannic bite, this Cab has soft red fruit and a menthol quality to it that doesn't seamlessly mesh together.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,30
102630,"Intensely floral on the nose, this is a blend of 70% Pinot Grigio grown in Carneros, 15% Traminer also grown in Carneros, and 15% Moscato giallo from Lodi, which the producer has previously employed in delightful wines of its own. Lilting and bright, it has substance behind the equal balance of fruit and spice, offering a taste of lemony ginger and pear.",90,US,California,White Blend,24
62424,"Styring releases their wines with plenty of bottle age and doesn't shy from high alcohol. The level of ripeness in this bottling is not for everyone, veering more toward Zin-like power than Pinot Noir elegance. It's lushly aromatic, with dominant pine needle and raspberry extract flavors. A dense, concentrated and pungent wine with a spicy top note.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
147164,"Shows all the fine qualities you want in a Merlot, such as ripe, sweet cherry and blackberry fruit, finely ground tannins, balancing acidity and a touch of oak. If only it had concentration, it would be a far better wine.",85,US,California,Merlot,22
1853,"This soft, robustly ripe wine shows a raisin-like prune character, tasting somewhat chalky on the palate.",83,US,California,Zinfandel,34
45476,"Matured in 50% new French oak, this wine offers medium concentration and appealing scents of rose petals, apples and cranberries. The tangy fruit is juicy and firm, and nicely balanced for cellaring.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,38
116574,"A beautiful young Rutherford Cabernet, showing the dusty elegance and complexity of a top estate. There's a rich herbality to the cherry, cassis and blackberry fruit, suggesting fresh green chervil, sage and thyme. Oak adds harmonious notes of vanilla, cedar and char. The tannins are thick and juvenile, but very finely ground. With 8% Cabernet Franc, this lush wine needs time. Hold until after 2008, and it should improve for another six years, conservatively.",94,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,75
29716,"This features an appealingly toasty aroma, substantial cherry and cassis fruit and a concentrated core. Elements of stem wood, black olive and clean earth filter through the finish, along with perfectly ripe tannins.",88,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,10
28200,"You'll want to stash this young Cab away for a while because it's too closed and tannic now for enjoyment. But it has a very rich, concentrated core of cassis flavor and is dry and balanced in acidity. Should negotiate the next 6–8 years easily, and maybe longer.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,55
43115,"At 1.8% residual sugar, this estate-grown Riesling carries some definite sweetness, along with a tangy mix of lime, grapefruit and citrus peel. Leesy and textural, it puts the focus on citrus rather than floral flavors, and tails off in the finish.",88,US,Washington,Riesling,15
69535,"A little earthy, with plummy aromas accompanied by sun-dried tomato, rhubarb and hard spice notes. The flavors are along the same lines, with cherry tomato, coffee and spices. It's very dry, and finishes with a slightly dusty, tannic bite.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,28
56926,"What's so likeable about this Cabernet is the dryness and the overall balance, which is stylish and elegant. It keeps the blackberry and black currant fruit in check with earthier tones of tobacco and olives.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,38
117824,"This wine shows apparent barrel aging on the nose, with vanilla bean and coconut oil alongside caramelized apricot aromas. There is a very ripe papaya and guava tropicality on the palate, with a slight finish of iodine.",86,US,California,Pinot Gris,20
388,"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,25
7548,"Just lovely to drink now, it's so softly lush and decadently delicious. Beguiles the palate with jammy, pastry flavors of raspberries, cherries and sweet oak. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.",91,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,50
11882,"Lychee, roses and sweet white peaches abound in this classic Gewürztraminer. While ebulliently perfumed and slightly brawny in footprint, its bold strokes are balanced with fresh grapefruit acidity. Delicate murmurs of rose potpourri and tea leaves fringe the finish.",88,US,New York,Gewürztraminer,15
47489,"Delicious in raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with an elaborate coat of sweet, smoky, caramelized oak. Good acidity and smooth tannins make for fine structure. Could be drier and more complex, but it's a hedonistic Pinot Noir with lots of flash.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,38
53853,"Drunken peach, green apple, gray slate and rounded butter notes hit the nose. There is a baking soda minerality on the palate, some sea salt and a tongue-tingling acidity.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,15
55219,"Part of the winery's Terroir Series, this is aromatic with bright raspberry fruit dotted with peppery herbs. It displays the spicy herbaceousness of this AVA, with excellent penetration and balance. A strong finish hits a resonant note of minerality.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,39
121116,"Made from Zinfandel, Malbec, Sangiovese and Pinot Noir, this tastes rich in cranberries, watermelons and strawberries. The acidity is refreshingly tart, but the ripe fruit flavors make it somewhat cloying on the palate.",84,US,California,Rosé,21
63929,"Drink this polished Chardonnay now with shellfish or chicken stew. It's crisp and minerally, with a hit of acidity backing up the citrus fruit, honey and vanilla oak flavors.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,26
5655,"Comprised of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Merlot, this is a juicy, savory and lengthy wine, with herbaceous elements of cedar, brush and peppercorn. A lush, full-bodied complement of baked plum and cherry ride out a lengthy finish.",90,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,75
38026,"This wine's thick and buttery aromas range from cashew cream and caramel to honeysuckle and Maui onion. Its powerful acidity cuts through the palate's unctuous and oily qualities, with buttercream and lemon juice flavors combining for a big personality.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,25
7535,"Brisk in acids, with lush, long hangtime lemon, kiwi, tangerine and vanilla flavors. It's all upfront in this drily delicious Chardonnay.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,26
73182,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling has a nose that suggests boysenberry, blackberry and black cherry. The dense aromas are livened up by iron, black loam, Indian spice and black-tea notes. The same range of dark fruits power the palate, especially black plums, and the rich and tangy flavors are nuanced with black sage, bergamot and eucalyptus notes.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,66
120098,"This is one of those old-fashioned field blends of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Carignane and who knows what else. It's super-fruity, with waves of blackberries, cherries and all kinds of other berries accented with milk chocolate, anise and cedar. Finishes a bit sweet and tannic. Drink now, with barbecue.",87,US,California,Red Blend,75
80609,"This unusual blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec comes from the folks who own Stagecoach Vineyard high atop Atlas Peak. A bombastically dense and concentrated wine, it's gamy, meaty and brawny all around. Black fruit, tar and tobacco combine to full-bodied effect. It would be best to wait on this one, cellaring through 2020.",92,US,California,Red Blend,100
68272,"Delicious berries and cream nose, which follows through with crisp, spicy flavors and good structure. OVOC stands for “old vines old clones” and the fruit, from head-pruned, hillside vineyards, lives up to its billing. Great all-purpose Zin.",90,US,California,Zinfandel,18
89536,"Here's a simple little wine that makes for pleasant drinking at an affordable price. It's lemony and dry and soft in acids, but it is very clean and is fine for fried chicken, fruit salad and other picnic-type fare. —S.H.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,10
71270,"This blend of 33% Cabernet Franc, 27% Merlot, 27% Petit Verdot and 13% Cabernet Sauvignon is mildly concentrated on the nose and palate, with rubbery blackberry, cranberry juice and geranium leading the way. Light bodied, with a soft grip of tannins, these flavors lead to a short finish of green peppercorn.",84,US,Virginia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,33
75855,"Argyle's Reserve shows less oak than the Nuthouse and Spirithouse bottlings, with more compact and vivid fruit. Nice flavors of stone fruits, grapes and citrus, well integrated and full through the mid-palate. It rounds into a very pretty finish, fruit forward, balanced and true.",90,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,20
73160,"A beautiful and compelling Sauvignon Blanc that gives the acidity and citrusy brightness you want in the variety, but contains extra layers of complexity. Offers waves of fresh green grass, Meyer lemon, sweet lime and mineral flavors that don't appear to have any oak. Brilliant with crab cakes, toasted sourdough bread with goat cheese, or on its own as a cocktail sipper.",91,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
23245,"Elusive raspberry tries to find its way to the fore of this big-bodied Pinot, its time in oak apparent yet integrated. Savory herb notes provide a complexity and balance against the dark cherry fruit, rounding out a wine that has girth but also finesse.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
44852,"Capturing the dense essence of Petite Sirah, this marries deep berry flavor to a highlight of Bourbon-soaked chocolate. It's not overly sweet, but it's definitely a dessert wine.",91,US,Oregon,Petite Sirah,24
106815,"Anyone who doesn't love this Pinot just doesn't understand California's approach. It's a fantastically delicious wine, completely satisfying in raspberry, cherry, persimmon, toast, spice and vanilla flavors, and balanced with bright, coastal acidity. Just beautiful, and it grows better as it warms in the glass. Probably not an ager, but wonderful now and through 2013.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,70
63431,"This estate-grown, pure varietal effort is exceptionally rich and succulent. The flavors of sugared grapefruit, lemon pulp and rind and sweet tea are concentrated and lingering. Despite the impression of sweetness, it's not a dessert wine, just an especially ripe and rich one.",90,US,Oregon,Viognier,24
90873,"The year 2014 was a fine vintage for reserve-level wines, and this one brings concentrated cherry-berry fruit into a generous midpalate. Those big forward fruit flavors wrap through the finish, which is lightly touched, though not seriously impacted, with a glue-like note.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,32
117236,"For the price, this is a good, sound Sauvignon Blanc for everyday purposes. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with somewhat watery lemon, lime, grapefruit and vanilla flavors.",83,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,7
78875,"This wine starts with a spicy nose of black cherry, pepper, and a touch of green pepper. The palate offers lean and spicy flavors of green pepper, herbs and cherry. The wine is a touch angular, but paired with a richer dish, will balance out.",82,US,New York,Cabernet Franc,24
43692,"Starr Ridge is a two-block site originally planted by winemaker Gary Farrell and farmed by Ulises Valdez. This Cooper Block is incredibly structured and lengthy on the palate, a rich expression of strawberry, high-toned citrus and anise. Playing supporting roles are earth and forest floor.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,58
91194,"This is the first time a Cabernet Franc has been made at Spring Valley since 2003. It's rich and earthy, tannic and concentrated, with plum and black cherry dusted with light mocha. Smooth and supple in the mouth, it glides into a tasty finish with toasted almonds.",91,US,Washington,Cabernet Franc,50
76037,"Sweet and oaky, with orange, pineapple and pear jam, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Plays it safe down the middle by appealing to the popular taste.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,26
41394,"A pure Cabernet aged in 100% new French oak with soft tannins, rich textures and inviting aromas of herbs, flowers and mushrooms. Worth checking out if you're interested in what Temecula Valley can do.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
22690,"A brisk, bright Chardonnay, made in the Testarossa style of ripe fruit and oakiness. What it lacks in subtlety it makes up for in the sheer power of tangerine, pineapple and tropical fruit flavors, elaborated with vanilla cream and caramelized oak.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,20
126111,"At this price it's hard to find a really good Pinot Noir, but this one is as close as you'll get to the real thing. It's dry and silky and crisp, with flavors of cola, cherry tea and peppery spice.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,13
30427,"A rich, somewhat one-dimensional wine. It has ripe orange, peach, lemon and lime flavors, brightened with plenty of zesty acidity.",85,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
132433,"Testarossa is one of the few wineries to make a statewide bottling that's more expensive than their vineyard-designated ones. In this case, the wine is indisputably delicious. It's soft and accessible, with luscious fruit, spice and oak flavors, and sweetness in the finish. But it's not better than Testarossa's other Pinots.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,75
57649,"Cyrus is the winery's highest expression of Cabernet. This 2010 shows the softness and slight herbaceousness of Alexander Valley, but it's rich and delicious in blackberries, cherries, currants and sandalwood. Blended from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it holds subtle complexity.",92,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,65
14288,"Semi-sweet and tasting like cherry-flavored cough medicine, this Merlot leaves a lot to be desired. But it's serviceable.",81,US,California,Merlot,25
53054,"Fruity and direct, and a bit sharp in acids, with jammy flavors of blackberries and cherries. Okay as an everyday red.",85,US,California,Syrah,22
50861,"Buttery, caramelized oak tones dominate the weak fruit flavors of orange and apricot. A simple and creamy Chardonnay.",82,US,California,Chardonnay,13
59132,"This Tempranillo gives off intense aromatics of ripe berry pie and has a crisp, smoky finish. In between it's big and brawny, delicious and rustic around the edges. On second sip, the flavors are wrapped in vanilla-kissed oak.",85,US,California,Tempranillo,22
94969,"A little too soft for true balance, but with pleasant cherry, cola, vanilla and spice flavors. Finishes abruptly. Drink now.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
52743,"This bouyant red starts with red berry and spice aromas, leading into a balanced, pleasant array of red berry, black cherry and cedar on the palate. Friendly and expressive, it's a quaffable wine for myriad occasions.",85,US,New York,Cabernet Franc,18
13897,"A special reserve from the producer's vineyard designate of Stagecoach, this wine is layered and full bodied in red licorice and generous oak. Soft, integrated tannins wrap around an herbal underscore that's further cradled in cherry and chocolate.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,150
105885,"Passes muster for its tropical fruit and vanilla cream flavors. Turns a little cloying and sweet on the finish, though.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,21
86907,"While this is full bodied, with an unctuous quality, it has plenty of acidity to keep the palate feeling lively and defined. The notes of butterscotch, candied apple and citrus blossom are pleasing, leading to a brisk and slightly warm finish.",86,US,Missouri,Vignoles,21
104796,"Seems somewhat crisper and less weighty than prior vintages, with the custardy mouthfeel buttressed by lemony acids. You'll also find apples, sweet plums and the obligatory toast and vanilla. —J.C.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,23
144155,"Black currants, cherries, chocolate, tobacco, coffee, cola and dusty Asian spices mark this dry, young Syrah. Turns a little rustic and thin on the finish, but the flavors are rich and interesting.",87,US,California,Syrah,25
69154,"I love this wine for its heft, polish and sheer razzle-dazzle. It wows with fruity intensity and flatters with decadence, yet never loses elegance and harmony. Rich in ripe, sweet tannins, and succulent in cassis, cocoa and smoky new oak flavors, it's an ager. Drink now through 2015.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
49307,"The winery struggled last year with this bottling, but has made good progress with this dry, richly balanced 2006. It's an easy wine to drink now, medium-bodied and silky, with lush flavors of black currants, chocolate, licorice and cedar.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,35
101505,"Winemaker Dave Potter heads to his old haunting grounds around Rancho Cucamonga to source fruit for this fun bottling, which shows wet soil and sour cherries on the nose. The palate is very down the middle and built to please, with flavors of cherry and baking spice.",88,US,California,Rosé,24
5408,"Estate-grown, though it is not indicated on the label, this matches black raspberries to a lightly toasty frame. The wine spent just under a year in French oak prior to bottling. The fruit and oak components are in good proportion, but another year or two in bottle will help to meld the flavors.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,29
68064,"The oak contributes buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors to this dry, crisp wine, but the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support all that weight. Shows only modest flavors of pineapples, kiwis and minerals. Disappointing.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,25
26467,"Solid and full-bodied, almost blocky, this big-boned Chardonnay wraps its banana and light tropical fruit flavors in a generous layer of toasty oak. The acidity keeps it fresh, but it's a drink-soon style.",88,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,27
103518,"Decadently ripe peach and blossom notes are accented by a curious touch of vanilla sugar in this sunny, off-dry Gewürztraminer. It's a hint reedy on the palate, but refreshingly brisk and easy drinking.",86,US,New York,Gewürztraminer,16
23604,"This is a keeper. Smoky, charred aromas, rich dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and boysenberry and meaty, peppery accents fill up this full-bodied and very firmly textured wine. It will get even more interesting with age; try it after 2020.",91,US,California,Petite Sirah,35
53320,"This vintage's blend is 50% Syrah, 25% Cinsault and smaller percentages of other varieties. It's an oaky, cedar-tinged, gamy red that's big in the mouth, dense and tannic with Michael David's smoky signature.",87,US,California,Red Blend,18
14463,"Very ripe, offering a burst of cherry-berry fruit flavors and hints of violets, leather and smoke. Could be a little firmer and drier, but it's a nice, full-bodied red wine.",87,US,California,Petite Sirah,65
58077,"There are lots of rich, attractive flavors of black currant, herb and dark chocolate in this Cabernet, plus a deft touch of smoky oak. It feels just fine in the mouth, and it's ready to drink now.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
76589,"This is the estate bottling, barrel-fermented in French oak and put through full malolactic. Spice and toast frame perfectly ripened tree fruit flavors of apple, pear and orange peel. The concentration and length suggest that this Chardonnay can be cellared for up to a decade.",94,US,Washington,Chardonnay,40
12632,"Vanilla-soaked French toast and caramelized apples promise a butter bomb in this Testarossa take on the historic Sierra Madre Vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. Once sipped, there is a surprising level of soda-like acidity, and a steadily emerging flavor profile that ranges from cream soda to squeezed lime.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,45
61115,"As the name indicates, this limited reserve is a selection of the winemaker's best barrels. It was fermented with 90% whole clusters, and aged 15 months in one-third new French oak. There are ample scents and flavors of stem, leaf and root, which dominate. Give this wine a lot of breathing time or a vigorous decant, which will help to bring the fruit back up.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,49
29971,"A big, dry wine rich in red fruit and sizable tannins, this 100% varietal, single-vineyard designated offering is buoyed by silky, fine-grained tannins that support its voluptuous nature. More savory than sweet in terms of ripeness, its flavors lean toward tobacco and black tea. Drink now through 2022.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,125
65594,"An exquisite wine that combines delicacy and harmony with enormously fruity-spicy flavors that fill the mouth. The aromas suggest candied ginger, tropical fruits, vanilla and wildflowers. The flavors are effusively fruity and on the dry side, with refreshingly crisp acidity. Try it with Asian-Pacific fusion foods.",87,US,California,Gewürztraminer,12
281,"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,34
111801,"This blend of Pinot Blanc and Chardonnay brims with spicy tangerine, orange cream and vanilla flavors. It's very rich, yet dry, while brisk acidity makes the finish clean. Not terribly complex, but an agreeable wine.",86,US,California,Pinot Blanc-Chardonnay,21
24094,"Fresh primary red cherries and berries are nuanced with complexities of soil, smoke and tobacco in this lovely blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Cutting cranberry acidity and fine persistent tannins lend four-square structure. The finish lingers on subtle touches of smoked nut and cedar.",90,US,New York,Meritage,40
82350,"A bit harsh and rustic in the mouth, with tart acidity and thin cherry, cola and spice flavors. Nonetheless, it's nicely dry and clean.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,18
23744,There's a real bite of lime juice that brightens the ripe raspberry and persimmon flavors on this Pinot Noir. Pair with rich meats and cheeses for balance.,88,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
134733,"Lush, polished and detailed, this is as elegant as any Washington Syrah can be. Intensely fruity with lively raspberries and plums, it layers in details of earth, mushroom, pepper and herb, leading to a perfectly balanced, structured finish.",93,US,Washington,Syrah,40
109368,"Full-bodied, ripe and round, this tangy Merlot is swathed in liquorous barrel flavors. It needs decanting to smooth out the alcoholic burn, and let the fruit emerge from the lumber yard. But it's fine tasting, with a rich chocolaty finish, designed to please those who enjoy a California style red.",87,US,Washington,Merlot,22
25728,"Mocha chocolate and cherry pie scents linger on the palate of this plush, easy-drinking Cab Franc. Straightforward yet densely fruited with fleshy cherry and strawberry flavors, it finishes on a pleasant caramel note.",84,US,New York,Cabernet Franc,19
2950,"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",86,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,30
23516,"A blend of Vignoles and Vidal Blanc, this wine is mildly aromatic, with white peach, apple and orange tones. Light bodied and semisweet in style, the palate brings juicy red apple and pear into the mix, balanced by a tropical-citrus twang.",86,US,Michigan,White Blend,14
2814,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah shows a somewhat uneasy mix of woodspice, green herb and cherry aromas. Flavors are pleasant, lighter in style and easy drinking, with a refreshing finish.",86,US,Washington,Red Blend,14
35620,"Simultaneously light, vivacious and flavor-packed, this bottling is a lightly faded shade of pink in the glass, and shows delicate bubble gum, sliced watermelon, pink rose buds and a squeeze of lime on the nose. The blend of 45% Grenache, 30% Mourvèdre and 25% Syrah offers zesty acidity and a pithy texture on the palate, with bright tangerine, lemon pith and a touch of strawberry fruit.",91,US,California,Rosé,38
118507,"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary lemondrop candy, Lifesaver pineapple and vanilla extract flavors. Malolactic fermentation adds even sweeter tastes of buttered popcorn. Praiseworthy for its acidic freshness, but rather heavy-handed.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,25
89899,"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle. What's already there is cassis, tar and earth, finishing with a light but balanced fade.",88,US,Washington,Merlot,25
89971,"Welcoming and easy to drink, this full-bodied wine has mellow, ripe fruit flavors, light oaky accents and a warm sense of ripeness that doesn't go over the top. Subtle tannins support the texture while keeping it smooth. The blend includes Zinfandel, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah.",89,US,California,Red Blend,11
41071,"Damp sagebrush, strawberry syrup and rust greet the nose on this bottling by Terravant in Buellton. The palate shows pomegranate, black licorice and a orange-rind bitterness.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,13
132224,"This is half estate-grown Sangiovese but done in a Super Tuscan style with half the wine comprised of Cabernet and other Bordeaux reds. Soft, smooth, silky and lush, it's loaded with black fruits and new oak accents of toasted nuts, butter, caramel and chocolate. It's seductive and warm, forward and immediately appealing, yet built to age.",91,US,Washington,Red Blend,40
12325,"Bright in acidity, which gives it a mouthwatering vitality. It's also a little ripe with Meyer lemon fruit. The result is sweet-and-sour, with the finish turning sugary.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,22
28306,"A soft, easy wine to drink now. It's rich and ripe with apricots, peaches, green apples and limes, with a spray of fragrant honeysuckle. Finishes a little hot in alcohol.",86,US,California,Pinot Gris,20
125393,"Softly appealing, with rich flavors of raspberries, cherries and spices. Oak barrel aging adds textured notes of vanilla, smoke and caramel. A pretty, polished Pinot Noir for drinking now.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
124740,"This is a woody, generously oaked white that's full and relatively fleshy, with a perception of ripe sweet fruit and vanilla.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,25
99183,"The winery's annual showing of “minimal intervention techniques,” this wine offers lime peels, yellow grapefruit and cut grass on the expected and excellent nose. There is a nice pepperiness to the palate, from green pepper to chopped oregano, basil and thyme.",90,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,19
34599,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 43% Cab Franc, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 5% Malbec, with no Petit Verdot in 2009. Young and muscular, it's built upon a base of firm black fruits, with plenty of cassis. The wine spent 20 months in 60% new French oak, and brings plenty of roasted coffee bean and dark cacao goodness to the finishing tannins.",92,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,35
112013,"One of the ripest, highest alcohol Mondavi Reserve Cabs in memory, this wine is forward in cassis and cherry flavors, and while the tannins are pretty sturdy, it's sweet and soft enough to drink now. It definitely has the rich mouthfeel you want in a pricey Napa Cab. But it's young; cellar this one until at least 2010.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,125
52818,"This is a very rich wine. Complex, too. With every sip, it seems to offer a little more of itself. On the surface, it's dry, tannic and fruity, with blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and cedar flavors. But it has mineral and herb nuances that seem to spring from the soil, and the depth and finish are impressive. Drinkable now for sheer luxury, and should continue to develop over the next decade.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,105
12445,"The entry-level Pinot in the Ayoub lineup would be the top cuvée for any number of wineries. Full and fruity, with rich cherry flavors backed with defining minerality, it's powerful, deep and immaculately clear.",93,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,38
2343,"A soft-textured, rather light-bodied and fruit-forward offering, this smells and tastes like pear, apple and grape juices with a touch of sweetness and low acidity.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,10
82687,"Zerba's crowd-pleasing Wild Z blends Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah about equally, with a splash of Cabernet Franc to finish it off. It's a ripe, full, forward, chocolaty mouthful. It keeps the red fruit tart and tantalizing, while loading in the barrel flavors (French and American) to round off the finish. A fine follow-up to the excellent 2006.",88,US,Oregon,Red Blend,20
38835,"Coming from the dramatic Lindsay's Vineyard, which rises from 500 to 1,000 feet in the Sta. Rita Hills, this highly nuanced wine overdelivers on multiple fronts. The nose mixes floral notes of violet and rose with an herbal tone of dried oregano, alongside fruity sour cherry. On the palate, there's graphite, espresso, purple flowers like lavender and a tad of tobacco, both fresh and smoked.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
71726,"Soft and simple, this dry Syrah has a light, silky texture, with polished cherry, spice, root beer and sweet oak flavors. Finishes pleasantly balanced. Drink now.",84,US,California,Syrah,20
23229,"Rugged in the mouth, with edgy tannins, this Merlot also features ripe berry-cherry fruit that seems a little sweet. Ready to drink now.",86,US,California,Merlot,35
37770,"Nice and dry, with fine, firm tannins. Quite a good wine, but kind of one-dimensional, with ripe red cherry purée and oak flavors that don't develop beyond that in the mouth. Shows the risks when you depend on 100% Cabernet Franc to make a complete wine.",87,US,California,Cabernet Franc,51
38901,"Pleasant acidity and a tannic edge supports the oak-accented cherry, rhubarb, pomegranate and plum flavors. Rich and ripe, this Pinot Noir is for drinking now.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
147903,"It has a deep, candy-red color, but the nose is anything but candied, showing aromas of green olives, herbs and blackberries. Salivatingly tart and only slightly sweet. The flavors are a combination of green olive and iced tea with lemon. It's not subtle, and would probably work with Buffalo wings.",80,US,California,Merlot,7
102045,"This is soft and simple, with mild cherry, spice and cedar flavors. It's not very rich, but it's nice and dry.",84,US,California,Merlot,18
23282,"From the producer's dry-farmed estate vineyard, and supported by small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine is elegant in sage and black cherry, silky on the palate in satisfying ways. Savory tea and an element of chocolate truffle give it additional complexity around a core of silky tannin.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,48
53764,"The valley is in a remote, warm part of Napa County. The wine is quite good. Rich and softly opulent, it offers waves of red cherry, raspberry, chocolate, orange tea, anise and Asian spice flavors that go on and on. Not an ager, but delicious now and through 2011 or so.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
14620,"An assortment of cocoa, medicine cabinet, dried herb, licorice and cherry aromas take the lead on this appealing wine. It's rich and silky in feel with generous chocolate, cherry and vanilla flavors followed by a tart finish.",91,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,32
57121,"A sensational Pinot Noir for its complexity, ageability and sheer deliciousness. The parts haven't come together yet, but each is great. Smoky new oak dominates, closely followed by enormously ripe crushed cherry, blackberry, pomegranate, cola and mocha flavors. There's a rich tannin-acid structure, and the sweet, spicy oak reprises on the finish. This big, masculine wine needs time to come together. Should open by 2008 and increase in desirability for a number of years.",96,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
10715,"Dark in color and viscous in texture, this wine shows dried plum, concentrated blueberry, cola, licorice and kirsch on the nose. It's powerfully flavored on the palate, with cooked cherry and mulberry fruit, as well as vanilla and ginger spice. It will be exciting to see what the new winemaking and ownership team does with this iconic estate.",88,US,California,Grenache,25
72482,"A reversal from past Syrcas, this flips the blend to 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah. It remains a sensational value, introduced with a beguiling nose of toast, smoke and coffee grounds. The tart, tangy red-fruit flavor has length and style; the wine seems sculpted.",91,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,16
138077,"Ripe and balanced, a nice, clean Merlot to drink now with savory sausages. It's dry and tannic, with flavors of black cherries, black currants, cola and sandalwood, and a dusty, mouthwatering coating of Asian spices.",87,US,California,Merlot,18
59079,"Made from 100% Lake County-grown Riesling grapes, this opens with sweet aromas of nectar and golden honey. It's pretty and off dry (30 g/L residual sugar), remaining balance because of its crisp acidity.",88,US,California,Riesling,13
5038,"From one of the four Pinot Noir vineyards that this producer controls as monopoles, this dark-hued bottling shows blackberry, black plum, clove and star anise aromas. Tart cranberry, sour cherry and strawberry fruit marks the palate, rounded with rose petal and sage elements.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,65
18068,"Rich as can be, but oak dominates, giving the wine buttered toast and caramelized vanilla flavors, and you'll even find notes of buttered popcorn. Although there's lovely pineapple and citron fruit and fine Carneros acidity, this Chardonnay tastes overly manipulated.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,55
142684,"Smells oaky and spicy, but it's almost shockingly lean in fruit. Tastes like oak-flavored alcohol, acids and tannins.",82,US,California,Chardonnay,28
25230,"This is a good Zinfandel with some special qualities. It's full-bodied and very ripe, with berry-cherry flavors that have a baked, pie-filling warmth, and additional layers of olive tapenade and salted, dried beef. The finish includes Zin's savory wealth of peppery spices.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,34
116933,"I have not been a great fan of this winery's Bordeaux reds, and this one also has a countrified thing going on, despite some very ripe and lip-smacking cherry flavors. Half the oak barrels it was aged in were new.",85,US,California,Merlot,30
86553,"More oak than the wine can handle is what you get here, from the woody, buttery overtoasted nose through the soft, clumsy, creamy body.  It's a real challenge to find any fruit, so you had better like a fully wooded wine if you're going to take a crack at this one.",85,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,16
122416,"Assertive, tannic, and earthy, this includes generous and pretty plum and black cherry fruit in the core. A nice mix of tart, ripe fruit with the interesting flavor components of leaf and herb, olive and licorice, that extend the finish and put a frame around the fruit.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,18
90602,"Aged substantially in bottle, this wine has found its groove, sanguine in meat and game topped in currant, dried herb and cedar. Pomegranate and cranberry give it a high-toned minerality around integrated oak and tannin.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,199
4508,"With a majority of Pommard clone in this wine contributing to its undeniable breadth and depth, this rich, rewarding wine will benefit from further time in bottle. Sultry baking spice accents kirsch and strawberry, with understudies of tar, rose garden and tannin, all framed by moderate acidity. Cellar through 2023.",96,US,California,Pinot Noir,90
5208,"A scent of toasted oak fully wraps the nose, with touches of mint, fruitcake and blackberry underneath. Fine-grained, astringent tannins coat the tongue, and tangy acids gain steam toward the finish.",86,US,Colorado,Cabernet Sauvignon,30
80766,"Tough and gritty, with uneven tannins and some minty green flavors alongside the cherries, mulberries and red currants. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,24
106508,"Tight and tannic, with an herbal edge, this stiff and rather unyielding wine remains a bit puzzling. Hints of cranberry, mulberry and blueberry are somewhat overtaken by herbal, earthy notes.",87,US,Oregon,Malbec,25
24804,"Intoxicating on the nose, with super-sized fruit and floral aromatics, this slightly off-dry Riesling from Bloomer Creek is proof positive of just how ripe the 2010 Finger Lakes vintage was. Surprisingly complex on the palate, it reveals itself in layers of tea leaves and potpourri, crushed stones, and bracing orange-tinged acidity.",89,US,New York,Riesling,30
122749,"For some reason, the winery held the '06 back later than the 2007. Maybe because it was so tannic. Still is, with a biting, palate-shutting astringency made harder by the wine's extreme dryness. But there's a place for tannic, dry Syrahs, and this is a very good one, with precisely measured oak framing deep, impressive blackberry, leather and black pepper flavors.",91,US,California,Syrah,28
105315,"Much the same blend as the winery's ‘Red' wine, only here the Sangiovese is replaced with Cabernet Sauvignon. Light flavors of black cherry and herb characterize a rather flat-lining wine with lots of acid.",83,US,Washington,Cabernet Franc,23
178,"Juicy and soft in blackberry and black cherry, this wine is nicely resolved in terms of tannin and oak structure,. These provide weight on the back palate, with enough heightened acidity on the finish to stay on balance. Strawberry and dried herb close things out.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,29
146701,"Heavily oaked, with peanut aromas masking the fruit. But in the mouth it has more accessible fruit—mostly cassis—and once again the full allotment of wood. It's no surprise when it finishes buttery, and with coffee flavors. A tough one to call now. Will the wood integrate? Will the fruit emerge?",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
100517,"While most of this wine was fermented in French oak, a small percentage was held back in stainless steel. It finds a happy middle ground between creamy oak, even a touch of reduction, and a brightness of green apple and Jolly Rancher. It offers medium-bodied richness.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,32
18161,"This is a powerful wine, almost too powerful for its own good, with forward citrus, tropical fruit and vanilla-oak flavors.",86,US,California,Viognier,42
6738,"What a great wine for the price. It's made from various Napa mountain vineyards, and shows concentrated blackberry and black currant flavors, wrapped into superfine Napa tannins that go down with silky smoothness. Not cheap, but the price is a bargain compared to superexpensive Napa Cabs. At nearly 6,000 cases produced, it's a steal.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
145959,"Opens with blockbuster notes of blueberry, cassis, licorice, smoke and earth, all the while displaying great depth. Finely integrated cherry, herb, espresso, oak and soy flavors have that intense vitality that command attention. Full and well proportioned on the palate, the wine finishes long, with beautiful fruit and big but very even tannins.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
107308,"This shows the softness and red cherry flavors of a nice Merlot, with rich Napa tannins and a hint of green mint. It's a clean, dry wine for drinking now.",87,US,California,Merlot,30
65743,"Fine acidity and some dusty tannins give structure to this Viognier, grown in a mountain benchland between the Russian River and Napa Valleys. It's ripe with orange, tropical fruit and kiwi flavors and accented with toasty oak infuences, yet finishes dry and clean.",91,US,California,Viognier,36
63224,"An enormously appealing Cabernet, this is nearly as good as the magnificent but more expensive '09 Estate, showing concentrated blackberry, blueberry, cassis and mineral flavors that are wrapped into firm Diamond Mountain tannins. Beautiful to drink now and over the next six years.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
48527,"This is a soft, lush Chardonnay, with ripe, jammy apricot, orange, mango and honey flavors, accented with buttered toast and vanilla. It's a satisfying Chardonnay at one of the better prices out there.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,8
34552,"Iron, pomegranate and dust aromas show on the nose of this entry-level bottling from the Los Gatos producer. Bright red fruits and solid brown spice show on the palate that proves light, airy and easy as it dances across the tongue with energy.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,27
97260,"Sweet, soft and direct, like ripe blackberries, cocoa, anise, brown sugar, pepper and red wine mixed in a blender. Could develop bottle complexity down the road.",84,US,California,Barbera,25
12197,"Lots of smoky oak frames modest flavors of pineapples in this creamy wine. Production was 6,300 cases.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,23
83485,"Shut down by hard tannins and utterly dry, this fine young Cabernet is simply not ready to drink. It's very rich in blackberries, smoked meat and charred wood, with a finish that's fine, long and sweet in ripe fruits. Should blossom after 2014 and hold for a number of years.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
30862,"Coming from Stillwater Creek, Alder Ridge and McKinley Springs vineyards, this wine offers much to love, with notes of blueberry pie, toffee, vanilla and barrel spices. Flavors are rich and hedonistic, accented by quite tart acids and tannins that provide a somewhat surprising squeeze.",89,US,Washington,Syrah,28
12707,"This very fine effort may well be the best yet from Saffron Fields and consulting winemaker Tony Rynders. Cola, smoke, black cherry and cinnamon scents explode from the glass, and the mouthwatering palate continues along those lines. It's got the balance, length and crisp, defining acidity to continue to drink well through 2021 or longer.",93,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,55
96827,"A halo of waxy pollen lingers over fresh peach and lemon aromas. The palate is muddled with vague stone-fruit flavors, with crisp acidity leading to a short, simple finish.",85,US,Virginia,Albariño,25
135324,"This is a southern Rhône blend of Grenache and Syrah. It has some new oak and is very ripe, with explosive cherry pie and vanilla spice flavors. It seems to have noticeable residual sugar, making it almost a dessert wine.",84,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,18
35193,"Balanced and fresh, mixing berries, fresh herbs, black cherry and dried mushroom components, this medium-long, estate-grown wine is designed for significant short-term improvement. Delicious already, it seems poised to evolve gracefully through 2021.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
72515,"This is a big, sweet, extracted wine, for those who like Chardonnay packed with fruit. It tastes like buttered popcorn, orange jam, gingerbread and vanilla caramel.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,15
75453,"This is an elegantly constructed wine. It's not especially rich, but subtle in citrus fruit, roasted nut, jasmine, vanilla and oak flavors, brightened with notable acidity. A note of green sage is distracting.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,25
93616,"A gorgeous Cab that shows the density and concentration, but also the elegant structure, of a fine mountain vineyard. Dry and richly tannic, this 100% Cabernet has pinpoint flavors of currants, plums and cedar. Brilliant now, and should evolve through at least 2012.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,70
64483,"Feels hot and heavy in the mouth, and although it's fully dry, there's a Porty, cooked berry taste.",82,US,California,Merlot,18
78915,"This is only the sixth vintage that the Vineyard Select has been produced. Spicy and tightly built, this dense effort is made from Cabernet Sauvignon that was sourced from three Walla Walla vineyards. Notes of fig, cassis, chocolate, coffee and fresh earth are enlivened by a hint of citrus rind. All in all, it's a complex, well-appointed showcase of fabulous flavors.",94,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,48
86678,"This Right Bank-styled blend includes 19% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot. Despite its high (15.3%) alcohol, it's a meaty, complex wine that drinks much lighter. The berry/cherry fruit flavors are woven into a tapestry of earth, herb and spice, smooth and detailed, and the wine has a mouth-pleasing seamless quality that invites another sip, and another.",91,US,Washington,Merlot,26
105725,"A good everyday Chardonnay that shows crisp acidity and the ultra-dryness and cleanliness of a well-made Central Coast Chard. Made for drinking now, with lime, white peach and mineral flavors.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,25
109857,"The most structured of Sterling's recent releases and hence our favorite, the 2004 Diamond Mountain Ranch Cabernet boasts notes of cinnamon, cassis and clove, framed by firm tannins and finishing with a hint of anise. Drink 2008–2015.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
45728,"The vineyard is a great one, but this wine has some stubborn problems. It's dry and somewhat unbalanced, with awkward tannins and an unripe, green streak right down the middle. Tart acidity compounds the bitterness.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,55
82983,"The herbal, thin fruit is covered with a strong streak of vanilla. It finishes with bitter tannins.",82,US,Washington,Merlot,25
13161,"A tough wine to praise, although it's certainly drinkable with burgers and such if you're not fussy. It tastes thin and green, with blackberry and mint flavors that are sweet and sour on the finish.",83,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
131139,"Parducci's '03 True Grit was a sensation. The '04 is a worthy successor. Dry, tannic and amazingly rich, it floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, currant, leather, coffee, carob and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. Like any great young Petite Sirah, it will age for many years.",93,US,California,Petite Sirah,25
55883,"Bone dry and pretty tannic at the age of four-plus years, this Merlot has interesting flavors of cherries, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are fierce, but pliant. Should soften and mellow over the next 6–8 years.",89,US,California,Merlot,60
119741,"Plum, clove, cherry and spice aromas start this lively red from Missouri. On the palate, bright plum and cherry flavors are lifted by a bright acidity. Fruity and friendly, the wine will pair well with beef, fowl and soft cheeses.",84,US,Missouri,Red Blend,13
66018,"A light golden hue, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of toasty barrel spices, apricot and dried mango. It's full bodied, almost unctuous in feel, with abundant, sweet stone-fruit flavors and a lingering finish.",90,US,Washington,Chardonnay,28
108318,"Boysenberry, cracked rainbow peppercorns and dried rose petals show on the nose of this bottling, which plays to the lighter side of the grape. It's tart and brisk once sipped, with cranberry and pomegranate fruit given more complexity by a touch of wild fennel.",87,US,California,Cabernet Franc,36
101276,A streak of vanilla winds through the almost-sweet fruit flavors of this medium-bodied and soft-textured wine. Ripe cherry aromas and strawberry jam flavors come with very little tannin and low acidity.,86,US,California,Zinfandel,10
20578,"This blend of Tempranillo and Touriga Nacional delivers aromas of dried cherries, light herbs and graphite. There is a lot of acid on the palate, and the red fruit, lightly spiced flavors are reminiscent of an everyday table wine, just with higher sugar levels.",86,US,California,Tempranillo,34
53784,"A proprietary blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc, 3% Merlot and 2% Petit Verdot, Zephyr is thick and rich. It offers a ripe, juicy and soft expression of mocha, coconut and blackberry jam that's generous on the palate.",91,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85
87777,"The cool vintage has given this wine lots of perky acidity and dry tannins as well as an earthy, mushroomy quality to the blackberry and cherry flavors. Probably best enjoyed soon, but give it a decant before serving.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,45
95582,"This is a simple rosé that could withstand some concentration. It was crafted from barrel-fermented Pinot Noir, and it shows very light flavors of watermelon and strawberry.",84,US,Oregon,Rosé,15
82560,"Although this Pinot is captivatingly rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, it also has fine acidity and smooth, complex tannins, and a lovely overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Good as it is, there's no reason why it shouldn't develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,59
15303,"This lovely brut offers real Champagne-like finesse. It's rich and dry, with yeasty flavors of pineapples, lemon chiffon and raspberries. The mousse is creamy and smooth. This polished bubbly will develop with five years of cellaring.",90,US,California,Sparkling Blend,19
36603,"The nose on this densely layered wine show both the richness of caramelized citrus and the freshness of apple blossoms, with a touch of iodine tossed in for intrigue. There's a nice lime-like liveliness on the palate, though it is quite sour, with tart stone fruit flavors.",86,US,California,Viognier,25
101368,"Soft and accessible, this pushes pretty cherry fruit forward with pleasant notes of toast and mocha. Fermented with native yeast, it has an extra dollop of texture and detail.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,55
71046,"Awkward and overoaked, with apricot flavors and deficient acidity, which mars the slight sweetness.",81,US,California,Chardonnay,17
86289,"A little light in flavor and rustic, but the price isn't bad for a dry, robust Zin with decent cherry-berry flavors. The alcohol is low, and the finish is pleasant.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,12
90169,"This is a very fruity Cabernet in which blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and cola star, along with oak influences. It's bone dry, and the tannins are thick and firm, but finely ground. Jammy and immature, the wine wants time in the cellar. Hold until after 2013 and see what happens.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,90
101756,"Simple, fruity and sweet tasting, this has chocolate-covered raisin and blueberry jam flavors.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,22
62453,"There's a nice intensity of pineapple, guava and hoppy, floral aromas on the nose of this estate-grown Riesling. Racy and linear on the light-bodied palate, tart tropical fruits meet a chalky midpalate and carry to a brisk citrus finish.",87,US,Michigan,Riesling,25
11772,"This is dry, tannic and sharp in acidity. It has a significant core of black cherry fruit, but it seems overripe, as it develops a prune flavor. Drink now.",84,US,California,Tannat,30
63321,"This reserve-level bottling spends 15 months in French oak, and remains tight and hard, with blocky cranberry and strawberry fruit. It thins out quickly, with a reductive hint of rubber in the finish.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,70
110043,"When Hendry Zin is good, which it usually is, it's very good, and so it is with this ripe, flashy but balanced wine. Block 7, in particular, is as dependable as Zin gets. It's so delicious in jammy cherry, blackberry and cocoa flavors, yet dry and crisp, with that sip-me-again quality that quickly empties the bottle.",91,US,California,Zinfandel,29
105859,"Here's a young, hedonistic Pinot that captures the essence of RRV from a perfect vintage. Although it's ripely forward in cherry, pomegranate, Dr. Pepper, red licorice and cinnamon spice flavors, it shows a structural sophistication that elevates the score. Beautiful now, and should improve over the next 6 years.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
84987,"Quite dry and reaching just 12% alcohol, this smells of rose petal and lychee fruit. It's delicate and floral, showing dashes of lemon rind and mineral on the finish.",88,US,Oregon,Gewürztraminer,25
29734,"Clear and light in color, this complex vineyard-designate sings in tea and nutmeg spice, allowing for richer, riper flavors of baked cherry. Velvety in texture, it builds to a full-figured finish, echoing that initial savory intrigue of black tea.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
117178,"The aromas are generous, with notes of peach, pear and barrel spice. The palate brings a sense of restraint, pulling up on the finish.",88,US,Washington,Chardonnay,15
110468,"Jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors highlight this 100% Cab, along with plenty of sweet new oak. The tannins are bold, but ultra-refined. High alcohol lends some heat as well as a glycerine feel. It's an unctuous, delicious wine, although slightly overripe.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,145
90820,This single-vineyard Chard with no oak has a light bouquet with nuances of white florals and red apple. The palate offers more heft and concentration with flavors of peach preserves and clementine supremes. Lower alcohol with a medium-length finish; rich and tasty without being overdone.,86,US,New York,Chardonnay,11
54491,"A distinguished wine, but a very young one whose tannins dominate. The flavors are myriad and complex, ranging from currants and cherries through anise and plum sauce to the smoky cedar of the oak barrels in which it was aged. Drink now, with decanting, and through 2012. Cabernet, Sangiovese, Merlot, Syrah.",92,US,California,Red Blend,60
71399,"This hits the jackpot. You taste it and are struck by its incredible richness, but then the balance kicks in, making it all the more impressive. It shows intense mountain flavors of blackberry, currant and dark chocolate, which are set into firm tannins. New oak brings delicious layers of vanilla and buttered toast. So good now, you can hardly keep your hands off the cork, but it should develop for many years.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,80
5013,"This pink stands out for its Ruby Red grapefruit aromas, backed by touches of orange peel and chalk. The mouthfeel is grippy and energetic, recalling again a grapefruit's juice and pith. A perfect breakfast wine.",90,US,California,Syrah,20
44525,"Very light fruit flavors of citrus and yellow apple. The wine was done entirely in stainless steel, with no barrel aging, yet somehow a vanilla streak has snuck into the finish. It's yeasty and crisp, with a residual flavor of wet steel.",85,US,Oregon,Pinot Blanc,18
3153,"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",89,US,Washington,Malbec,30
49341,"Fresh and pretty, this has a bright, refreshing palate that offers flavors of cranberry and raspberry. It's smooth and fruit forward, with medium aging potential.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,20
98598,"The Aviator Red is a well-crafted blend that mixes strawberry, raspberry, pepper and stone in an effective balance that seems to draw the best from each grape. For a modest, everyday wine, this works quite well.",87,US,Washington,Red Blend,28
130126,"Heavy, sweet and soft, with syrupy flavors of milk chocolate, blackberries, anise and pepper. Will appeal to those who like this rustic, easy style.",83,US,California,Zinfandel,23
16554,"Tastes like the wine equivalent of a dessert pastry. It's soft and sugary sweet, with raspberry and cherry pie filling, white chocolate and vanilla flavors. High alcohol gives it a peppery heat.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,24
36153,"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat.",93,US,Washington,Syrah,28
96515,"This is the second vintage for Saggi, the newest Long Shadows collaboration, this one with Tuscany's Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari. The blend is again in the super Tuscan mold—45% Sangiovese, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah. Smooth, chocolaty and ripe, the wine is loaded with purple fruits, the flavors elegant and refined, bringing a lovely mix of fruit, barrel, spice and leaf together seamlessly.",90,US,Washington,Red Blend,45
148214,"Like autumn in a bottle, the subdued smoke and pear bouquet is followed by a buttered apple, toast and vanilla palate. The flavors are more understated than they sound—this wine is all about subtlety and balance. It builds in layers, complex and butter-smooth. The standout finish shows butterscotch and mineral notes in a delightful tension.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,47
13072,"An easy, gentle red wine, full-bodied and spicy, with extravagantly ripe cherry and blackberry flavors. Pretty good, but lacks those extra layers of complexity, so drink now.",86,US,California,Syrah,17
37289,"Merlot (78%) takes the lead on this blend, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (14%), Cabernet Franc (6%) and Petit Verdot (2%). Fragrant aromas of green tea, flowery herb, barrel spice and cherry aromas are followed by concentrated, silky-soft red- and black-fruit flavors and exquisitely integrated tannins.",91,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,55
124932,"With reverberating notes of crushed stone, this dry rosé, made predominantly from Pinot Noir, suggests a more mineral expression of rosé. The palate offers delicate raspberry and cherry flavors and a surprisingly plump mouthfeel that clings nicely through the finish.",89,US,New York,Rosé,15
6392,"Strong wood smoke and grilled meat aromas lead to equally assertive oak and dried herb flavors, giving this wine extreme personality. It has medium body and rather soft tannins and texture to balance.",86,US,California,Cabernet Franc,12
117765,"This elaborate wine offers delicious cherry-pie, mocha, red currant and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are smooth and flashy, and it's easy to drink. But it shows the limits of Cabernet Franc, which simply doesn't have the depth of Cabernet Sauvignon.",91,US,California,Cabernet Franc,125
128437,"The second release of this Oregon Pinot project from Walla Walla's Jon Meuret (Maison Bleue) is irresistible. A three-clone blend from a top Columbia Gorge vineyard, it's explosively aromatic, with a strong whiff of pipe tobacco that Meuret believes is a vineyard marker. Those powerful aromatics push into a dense core of strawberry-cherry fruit, enhanced by oak notes. Delicious now, this has the structure and power to cellar well. Drink now through 2028.",94,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
34088,"There's lots of sweet oak in this wine, with dominant flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn and vanilla. Underneath there's some nice apricot and tangerine fruit.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,14
49795,"Toil spearheads an ambitious Oregon project for Chris Figgins (Leonetti Cellar and the Figgins Family). A new vineyard is being developed in the Chehalem Mountains; meanwhile grapes are sourced from Ribbon Ridge and the Eola-Amity Hills. This svelte generous wine still has some baby fat from barrel aging in 30% new French oak. Cherry, cola and toasty oak flavors come together with a touch of underbrush. It's best to give this another year or two of bottle age. Drink it 2020 to 2026.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
19544,"Mellow, suave, complex and layered, this wine blends oaky spice flavors with delicious ripe fruit in a harmonious texture. It's medium-bodied, showing generous oak influence and a mouthfeel marked by firm tannins and acidity.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
34498,"This 100% Cabernet is a good wine, rich in blackberry, black currant and new oak flavors, and the tannins show that famous Stags Leap “iron fist in a velvet glove” quality. It seems a little hollow in the midpalate, reminiscent of the 2006 and 2007 vintages. Drink now–2017.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,125
44955,"Yeasty and noticeably sweet, with frothing bubbles. Nice package; simple flavors.",85,US,Washington,Sparkling Blend,12
142327,"Big, kick-butt Zin, richly flavored and satisfying. Waves of blackberries, coffee, cocoa, spices and herbs wash across the palate, with oaky notes. High in alcohol, and dry.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,24
51062,"Perfumed in violet, white pepper and leather, this expansive, medium-bodied red is sourced largely from vineyards in Coombsville, with 4% Cabernet Sauvignon added in. It explodes in blueberry, while taming its tannins through bright acidity.",91,US,California,Malbec,40
83133,"For this excellent blend, 25% new French oak was employed. It retains its vivid apple-flavored intensity, while bringing in pretty spice and a bit of buttered toast. The barrel aging helped to soften it up a bit. As young as it is, it drinks quite well and should hold until 2020.",91,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,40
105935,"A Bordeaux-style blend that is a barrel selection from estate fruit. The tannins are substantial in all the Cave B reds, but particularly so here––thick and astringent to the point of chalky. There is interesting depth and some high-toned red fruits.",87,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,45
70961,"Bright raspberry and fresh-pressed bramble make for a nicely snappy nose that also conveys a touch of rust, graphite and earthiness. Tart cranberry and plum skin mesh into mineral tones of slate and pencil lead, all lifted by bay leaf and dried sage. It needs time to reach full potential.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,62
32760,"This is a pretty basic Zin, fresh and tart in blackberry jam flavor. In its favor, it displays robust full-bodiedness and plenty of Zinny spices. At this price, it's fine with burgers, tacos, ribs.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,8
29909,"Wild berries, from elderberry to salmonberry to mountain strawberries, are in play in this wine. The underpinning scents suggest earth and wet cement, while in the finish a strong flavor of breakfast tea lingers. This is an interesting addition to the Sineann lineup.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,36
84327,"The amount of alcohol in this Syrah has increased in 2010, which will appeal to some palates. The downside is the loss of texture and subtlety. Smooth and powerfully fruity, this hits with some chewy tannins, but it stops a bit short. More bottle age could certainly be a boon to this wine.",89,US,Washington,Syrah,55
128926,"Soft, sugary and one-dimensional, with raspberry- and cherry-pie filling flavors plus the toasty, buttery crust.",84,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,40
17133,"Interesting; it's dry, refreshingly crisp and aromatic, with citrus and floral flavors. Try as a Sauvignon Blanc alternative.",86,US,California,Chenin Blanc,22
67944,"Soft and syrupy, with tons of oaky spice framing blackberry, cherry, raspberry and chocolate liqueur flavors, this high-alcohol blend of Syrah, Grenache and Petite Sirah tastes sweet and simple.",82,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,35
24701,"A beautiful Cabernet for drinking now and over the next few years. It's dry and fine, with appealing blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors all the way through the finish. Excellent price for a Cab of this quality. Easy to find with 36,000 cases produced.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
104446,"Here's a Merlot that just wants to support the food it's paired with, not dominate it. It's dry and balanced, teasing with cherries, herbs and oak, then pulling back to let the tannins and acids take a bow. Should develop a little complexity by spring 2008, but it's fine now.",87,US,California,Merlot,26
25959,"This Bordeaux-style blend, one of four from this tiny winery, is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. The somewhat thin cranberry and raspberry fruit, high in acid, is not quite substantial enough to completely shed its candied character.",86,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,24
39825,"This is as good a Pinot Gris as this producer has ever made. Apples and stone fruits contribute a fleshy, flavorful mid-palate. Peppery spice and a hint of brioche add complexity and interest. The wine is perfectly balanced and ready to drink immediately.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,17
21614,"L'Attitude needs a warm vintage to succeed, and it got one in '04. The wine, a blend of Carignane, Syrah and other Rhône reds, is dry and complicated, offering rich, earthy, Provençal herb flavors with fruitier tastes of cherries, blackberries and cola. Notable for balance, elegance and power. Drink now through 2010.",93,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,18
2805,"This blend of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is succulently smooth yet big boned and slightly smoky. Red cherry and berry fruit provides plushness on the palate, upheld by tight, firm tannins and supportive oak.",91,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,75
12479,"Winemakers fight to get fruit from this coveted vineyard, which famously produces ageworthy Pinots. Siduri's 2012 vintage is surprisingly versatile with lovely raspberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, accented with sweet oak. The balance is impeccable, with fine acidity and soft, refined tannins. You can certainly enjoy it now, but it should also develop well through 2018.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,52
94895,"Unique and pungent, with hints of diesel, green fruit and celery, this has some bite to it. Despite a green edge, it is precise and focused, with good grip and concentration.",89,US,Oregon,Arneis,25
144291,"Doesn't win your heart immediately. It's in your face in acids and tannins. But it is a very fine Pinot worth cellaring. It's rich in spicy, berry flavors, with a silky texture that will only get silkier. Try after 2008.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
123929,"A touch of raisins and raisinskin bitterness compromises this wine. Other than that, it's bone dry and tannic, with exuberant blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
76576,"Grown in one of the valley's best vineyards, it's eminently ageable. The flavors of black currants and minerals are intense and fine, complexed with new French oak. However, the strong tannins will jacket the wine for a long time before they begin to fall out. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2024, and it could be awesome in 2030.",95,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,150
42836,"At the age of five-plus, this is still a pretty aggressive wine in tannins, with a sandpapery astringency through the finish. But it's also incredibly fruity, offering a blast of superripe blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate and pepper. Seems best now and for a couple years.",88,US,California,Syrah,28
75675,"Hews to the Hanzell style, which is almost old-fashioned in this age of ripely opulent Pinot Noirs. This one's tight as a drum in tannins and acids, a quivery, nervously wound wine. Yet it's quite rich and complex, with a tapestry of cherry, red licorice, tobacco, Canadian bacon, dusty Indian spice and buttered toast flavors.  Needs 7–8 years in the cellar, and, based on tastings of very old Hanzell, should slowly unfold through the 2020s.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,145
68158,"Fruit fans will love the explosive blackberry, cherry, raspberry and vanilla mocha flavors of this wine. On the other hand, it's a bit obvious, with no real subtlety. Defines the easy, ripe California style.",86,US,California,Meritage,15
76568,"A controversial wine, tasted twice. It's soft and tannic, with candied cherry-berry, mocha and sweet oak flavors. Seems at once dull and powerful. Hard to know where it's going, but the benefit of the doubt suggests 4–5 years in the cellar.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,170
24815,"A selection of estate, Tualatin and Elton vineyard fruit, this carries the style of those wines to a more refined, high-toned level. The fruit is a bit more complex, and highlighted with baking spice, incense and toasted nuts. Just under 14% alcohol, it retains the essential character of the elegant Pinot Noir grape, but pushes it to a point where some heat comes into the finish.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
33274,"This wine opens with a curious aroma of fried foods, like hashed browns from a diner, before finding its sense of black fruit, mild spice and leather. Dry and somewhat puckering on the palate, it's full bodied and powerfully concentrated.",87,US,California,Tempranillo,45
114877,"Pure Merlot, from estate vines, this is tart and juicy, with a clean and acidic cut to it that is unusual for Merlot. It's got a lively and evocative nose that sends up aromas of mixed stone fruits, chocolate and butterscotch, but it's carefully made to conserve the acidic push of the fruit and not overwhelm it with barrel.",88,US,Washington,Merlot,16
56682,"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,36
23123,"This is a good, classic-style blend of Bordeaux grape varieties with just enough tannin to support the ripe blackberry and black-pepper flavors. It's dry, has medium body and a mouth-filling texture.",89,US,California,Red Blend,30
123316,"Bold and brawny, the Palmer Merlot offers up convincing scents of mulberries and vanilla backed up by a palate that's both juicy and gripping. Cherry, fall leaves and plum pudding flavors characterize the medium finish. Drink now or hold a few years for finer tannins.",87,US,New York,Merlot,19
85238,"A blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, this offering is defined in light, ethereal layers of soft, floral red fruit. The mix of pomegranate, cassis and cranberry is buoyed by natural acidity and a streak of black pepper.",90,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,50
57570,"This beautiful Pinot Noir drinks well now because it's so fruity, delicately structured and crisp. Shows oak-inspired and refined raspberry, cherry, cola, pomegranate and cedar flavors that finish in a rich swirl of exotic spices. Has the inherent balance to develop through at least 2014.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
63310,"The fruit is apricot through and through, concentrated and thick. This is softer and less acidic than most Washington Rieslings, with suggestions of butter and caramel. It should be chilled a bit to firm it up.",86,US,Washington,Riesling,10
148255,This Zin-Syrah blend is a bit raisiny and Porty. Finishes sweet.,83,US,California,Red Blend,15
5729,"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,85
34111,"This is a fun, creamy and rich wine made from a white grape native to Piedmont, Italy. This has intriguing tastes of sweet, tart fresh-squeezed lemonade, with a nutty, apple-driven acidity that lingers through the finish. Barrel-fermented, it would pair nicely with scallops.",88,US,California,Arneis,15
34610,"This is an elaborate wine that's dense, complex and immensely enjoyable. It has a fleshy, meaty quality, like a buttery veal piccata, alongside ripe white and yellow fruits. There's a firm, minerally quality, highlighted by crisp acidity, and the finish is bone dry. Gets more interesting as it warms up in the glass. One of the best examples of Roussanne out there.",92,US,California,Roussanne,65
44282,"Made with 75% Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine brings aromas of café au lait, toast and red fruit. It's full bodied, with coffee and cherry flavors that linger.",88,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,35
35559,"Fresh raspberries, red cherries and even blackberries arise on the juicy nose of this wine from Adam Lee, but it's lifted by wild mint, hummingbird sage and damp coyote scrub. The palate is very herbally spiced, with thyme, marjoram, black cardamom and charred pine, laid across dried strawberries, cranberries and sour cherries, all tied together by serious grip. Drink 2019–2025.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
65810,"Young, fragrant, and loaded with milk chocolate and spicy berry. Tight, tannic, with grip and tang; pleasingly moderate, listed under 14% alcohol. Although this has no Grenache in it, it has that sort of tart berry quality, with stiffer tannins.",88,US,Washington,Red Blend,15
18825,"Firm and sappy, with varietally true peach and apricot fruit flavor. Turns a little syrupy in the follow through, giving it a canned peaches impression in the aftertaste.",85,US,Oregon,Viognier,20
12667,"There is a significant change in the flavors of this wine following the outstanding 2009 version. Case production has almost doubled, but the light aromas and flavors seem heavily scented with black pepper, with additional herb and cherry flavors on the finish.",86,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
36189,"On the plus side, this is a well-ripened, full-bodied wine, with a mix of pear and citrus. It's lightly spicy and drinking at its peak, broad and just a little flat on the palate.",86,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,16
29154,"With the fruit coming from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and Yellow Jacket vineyards, this winery's inaugural Walla Walla Valley release displays complex aromas of coffee, smoked meat, mineral, blueberries, violets and licorice. The dark coffee flavors are concentrated and dense, coming in waves and leading to an extended finish.",93,US,Washington,Syrah,55
1150,"This blend of 32% Alvarelhão, 31% Souzão, 24% Touriga and 13% Tinta Cão shows baked black cherries, licorice, gingerbread, iron and smashed asphalt on the nose. The palate is soft and rich, with jammy cherry, blueberry and blackberry flavors eloquently spiced by clove, framed by silky tannins and cut with a welcome acidity.",90,US,California,Port,36
58061,"This is a big, bold Pinot Noir. It has a weight and density that are almost Rhône-like, with flavors of mashed cherries and blackberries, mixed with cola and sprinkled with cinnamon, cocoa and star anise. It feels luxuriously smooth in the mouth, with an impressively long finish. Best to give this gigantic young wine time in the cellar. Hold until 2008 or 2009, at least.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
95426,"With its tangy acidity, touches of green peppercorns and edgy tannins, this is a rustic wine. Fortunately, it has a lot of blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, with that distinctive briary character of Dry Creek Zins. Drink now with roasted or grilled meats or a vegetarian lasagna.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,28
114828,"Made by Paso Robles-based Ranchero from old vine Carignan grown in Mendocino's Redwood Valley, this still-young rendition of this rough and tumble Old World grape is densely rich and textured with aromas of blackberry and blueberry, clove and tobacco, with a nice kick on the finish. Winemaker/owner Amy Butler also makes the Edward Sellers wines from Paso Robles.",88,US,California,Carignan,28
35063,"Chandler Reach grew the grapes for this big, chewy, rather blocky Merlot. It offers pleasant red fruits and light chocolaty barrel notes.",83,US,Washington,Merlot,33
128583,"Not very subtle, but oaky and ripe, with strong flavors of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak. Made in the popular style, at a decent price.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,15
58979,"This Rhône-style picnic red is a blend of 47% Syrah, 29% Grenache, 12% Cinsault and 12% Mourvèdre. Scented with the spicy authority of the Syrah, the other grapes add meat and muscle and spread the flavors broadly out across the palate. It's got a good mix of smoke, spicy fruit, meat and sage. The name means “at the moment” and the moment is still a ways away, so air this one out.",90,US,Washington,Red Blend,28
25567,"Superrich in tangerine, peach, lime, mango and honey flavors, this Rhône-style white blend is balanced with crisp acidity and a nice touch of minerality. It's a wine to drink now.",87,US,California,Marsanne-Roussanne,35
29328,"A terrific vintage for the Freedom Hill bottling, the 2008 displays a firm, concentrated core of cranberry, raspberry and pie-cherry fruit flavors. Wrapped in plenty of toasty new oak, the wine is powerful and mouth-coating, balanced with juicy acidity, and rolls on through a lengthy, satisfying finish.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,40
67859,"Break out the pizza with tomato sauce and gooey, oily mozzarella. That's what this tough, gritty Bordeaux-style blend with added Sangiovese needs to soften and mellow. It's a good wine, ripe in berries and spices, but rustic.",85,US,California,Red Blend,17
84137,"Whiffs of minerality, waxy lemon peel and lanolin add complexity to lemon-honey flavors on the palate. It's dainty, with a steely acid backbone, and hints of saffron and spice on the finish. Made from grapes frozen after harvest.",87,US,New York,Riesling,30
140673,"After their disastrous 2004 Pinots, Cuvaison returns to form with this light, easy wine. It's dry and soft, with cola, cherry, root beer, licorice, peppery spice and vanilla oak flavors, and will be versatile at the table.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,31
42337,"Caramelized oak makes a statement in this wine that starts out richly and roundly, but finds a sense of balanced acidity in the glass. Medium bodied, it features classic notes of Meyer lemon and Gravenstein apple.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,30
47429,"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",99,US,California,Pinot Noir,75
68739,"Oodles of blackberry and ripe grape flavors characterize this smoothly textured, well-balanced red blend. Firm elements of tannin and acidity support the ripeness, and the wine tastes fresh and mouth-watering. This will be great with meat, pasta and cheese.",88,US,California,Red Blend,10
82541,"Very pale, thin and watery. The fruit is barely perceptible, a little watermelon and unripe strawberry. The tannins, too, are light, with a breakfast tea flavor.",84,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,35
49338,"Sporting a much-improved label design, the 2009 Natasha brings pungent, assertive scents of tomato leaf, pepper and moist earth. Sharp and focused, the fruit is there, though it's the leaf and earth components that stand out. For its earthy style, it's a well-made and complex offering.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,40
61044,"A thick structure surrounds grilled white peach and candied lemon in this full-bodied, creamy wine. It shows plenty of barrel impact and integration, a style for those who like their whites with some meat on their bones and curves in all the right places.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,55
55776,"Direct and fruity, this Chardonnay is loaded with lemon.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,10
118652,"This wine is lean on the nose and perfumed in honeysuckle and apple blossom. With its power in balance, the fruit can shine. Lemon and Gravenstein apple exude from the entry while a medium-toned structure buoys the subtle spicy notes of the oak, never letting them overtake the finish.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,35
79729,"Crisp and lemony with a full, honeyed and rich finish, this Portuguese white made out of the Sierra Foothills screams for seafood. If you've never tasted a California Verdelho, this would be a good place to start.",89,US,California,Verdelho,18
21680,"Merry Edwards doesn't just slap this regional blend together. This is a combination of her best vineyards. It's a wonderful wine, dry, balanced and deep in berry, spice, cola and earthy flavors. In many ways, it's the consummate Russian River Valley Pinot Noir. Drink now–2015.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
66119,"With all of the fruit coming from Gamache Vineyard, this wine brings aromas of lees, butterscotch and butter. It's elegant in style with a lightly creamy feel and flavors that linger.",87,US,Washington,Chardonnay,18
69763,"From a cool vintage, this blend of 65% Merlot and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon is still tight, offering an elegance of rose, dried cranberry and herb around sizable but not puckering tannins. Flavors of cherry and strawberry shyly reveal themselves in the glass, but the wine should develop further in the cellar, through 2021.",90,US,California,Claret,135
134896,"With 15.5% alcohol, this wine is too hot for balance. It also tastes unnecessarily sweet, with sugared raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors.",82,US,California,Zinfandel,27
90775,"Tastes fresh and jammy and slightly gassy, like a new Beaujolais, although it should calm down and settle by mid-2009. Then it will be a fine, fruity Zin, fruit-forward and dry in blackberries, cherries, raspberries, raisins, mocha and pepper.",85,US,California,Zinfandel,14
5810,"Vinegary overtones suggest a volatile wine from the first sniff. Flavors are high-toned as well, with plum and cherry. Some sort of barrel treatment brings in dark chocolate and espresso, with slightly burnt, bitter tannins.",85,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,24
24074,"A good effort in the rough-and-ready genre. Aromas are straightforward plum shot through with earthy notes. The palate shows good cherry fruit and is quite gripping, with slightly rustic tannins that carry over to the short finish. Give it a year in the cellar to smooth out, then try with hearty beef dishes.",85,US,New Mexico,Cabernet Sauvignon,22
41979,"A rich, polished Cabernet. Doesn't taste particularly Oakville-like, due to extreme ripeness, softness, high alcohol and refined tannins that could come from anywhere, but it's well crafted and delicious. Offers waves of blackberries, black currants, chocolate and cedar. Now–2013.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
73736,"Scouring and sweet, this wine features flavors of vanilla, yeast and ripe lemon meringue. It is easy to drink with almost anything, at price fit for everyday enjoyment.",85,US,California,Pinot Grigio,11
63760,"Mostly old (1972) Bacchus vineyard fruit is 100% Cabernet, and only the second reserve Cabernet ever produced by Abeja. It's dark, juicy, dense, smoky, layered and tight. Pepper, bacon, coffee grounds, graphite and black cherry roll through the palate, buttressed with lots of firm, smooth, polished and delicious tannins. A truly glorious bottle.",96,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,80
45420,"This is Pinot Gris that tastes quite a bit like Sauvignon Blanc: grassy and herbaceous, but with a little more flesh, less acidity. Match it with shellfish and light seafoods and it will do the trick; it's fresh and bracing.",84,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,14
59836,"Rhubarb and cranberry fruit, along with a touch of red apple suggests minimal ripening. It's a tangy, pleasant wine, light and optimal for near-term drinking with simple poultry dishes.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,38
34406,"Threads of licorice, steel, earth and smoke weave through the proportionate strawberry and raspberry flavors, offset by hints of herb and baking spice. It's a seamless, complex wine of moderate length.",90,US,Washington,Syrah,27
78884,"Abundantly floral, this is a 100% varietal wine. Juicy acidity supports a medium-bodied lushness of honeyed pear and spicy nutmeg complemented by oak.",90,US,California,Viognier,33
5122,"From a block planted in 1910 consisting of hearty portions of mixed blacks, this wine is abundantly floral in rose petals, with a plummy core dusted in smoky oak. The tannin structure is sizable, while the wine is full of leather, cigar box and black pepper accents that weave within the ripe fruit.",92,US,California,Zinfandel,48
67792,"I wish this wine were drier because it has polished citrus, floral and mineral flavors and a rich, pronounced acidity. But it's sugary throughout.",83,US,California,Albariño,10
108972,"Succinct and to-the-point, this Viognier is bight in pineapple, citron and peach on the nose and palate. There's a decent weight and texture, however the flavors don't carry too long. Drink now.",85,US,Texas,Viognier,25
110191,"Very peppery and briary, with a slightly green, minty edge to the riper wild berries and tobacco. A good, gutsy Zinfandel of character and a sense of place.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,25
76158,"Rapture is Michael David's small-production Cabernet, blended with a small percentage of Petite Sirah, then aged 17 months in French oak for a full-bodied figure. Purple-black in color, it's mouth-filling, jammy and extracted with flavorful blackberry and cherry fruit and a streak of vanilla and fig on the finish.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,59
114590,"A big but not-too-tannic Petit Verdot, this is juicy and structured with red fruit and a light layer of spice. Tending toward black licorice and dark chocolate, it could use a splash of something to brighten it up. But it's otherwise a bottle worth trying if you're curious to try a varietal Petit Verdot.",86,US,California,Petit Verdot,30
20508,"A solid everyday Chardonnay, showing good pineapple, peach and pear flavors, with a nice edge of buttered toast and vanilla.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,17
125513,"This wine is rich and ripe, oozing with black cherry, boysenberry and strawberry jam aromas and flavors. It feels full and rather soft on the palate, as the acidity and tannins appear very mild.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
11511,"A deliciously likeable Pinot Noir, sweet as a raspberry crumble pie, yet with qualities of mushrooms, minerals and something formidable from the earth that give it great complexity. The winemaker, Drake Whitcraft, has kept the alcohol to a relatively low 13.4% by volume, so the wine feels light and airy. Yet it possesses great seriousness. The vineyard is within a touchdown pass of the Santa Rita Hills boundary. Drink now–2020.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
143454,"Shows aromas of cherries, dust, spices and oak, with a twiggy, earthy note. Tastes very fruity, sappy, jammy, thick and full-bodied. Bone dry, youthful and tannic. Immature. Should begin to come together after 2006.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,75
58893,"This gorgeously inviting wine shines with barely ripe pear, lemon and lychee flavors. Its focused, stony minerality lends freshness and pleasing complexity on the palate, as orange blossom aromas and flavors seep in.",93,US,California,Gewürztraminer,30
130542,"This is a barrel selection from the winery's Sleepy Hollow Vineyard and is one of the most concentrated Chardonnays in California. Has the honeyed richness of a botrytized wine, but is absolutely dry. Tastes like an apricot and pineapple tart, with seasonings of nutmeg, cinnamon, and the smoky, nutty pie crust. Very few California Chardonnays need time, but this one does. Stash until late 2008, but this powerhouse should gradually peak over a decade.",94,US,California,Chardonnay,60
65349,"A fine Chardonnay, which Ferrari-Carano can usually be depended on to produce. Shows crowd-pleasing flavors of pineapple jam, butterscotch, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Easy to find, with 42,000 cases produced.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,25
111283,"A juicy Sauvignon Blanc, rich in ripe fig, lemon and lime and spicy melon flavors, and well acidified. Finishes with a clean, fruity note.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,15
124882,"Tannic and acidic now, with a bite-down mouthfeel, although the overall texture is nice and silky, and shows the elegance of Pinot Noir. Give it a few years in the cellar to let the black cherry, currant, anise and cedar flavors mellow and develop.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,37
110851,"Sugary sweet and simple, with pleasant pineapple, peach, pear, floral and vanilla flavors.",83,US,California,Roussanne,24
63374,"Some new French oak brings a rich, buttery smokiness to this Chardonnay, but mostly it's about the fruit. It's rich in tangerine, apricot and papaya flavors that are drinking well now.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,40
122992,"The texture of this Pinot Blanc is Chardonnay-like, but the flavors veer more toward tangerines and oranges, with a buttered toast, honey and vanilla richness. It's a rich, creamy, complicated wine, a little sweet and soft, but a good partner with complex lobster, shrimp and scallop dishes.",89,US,California,Pinot Blanc,22
93684,"This harsh wine is hard to like all by itself. It's severely tannic, with flavors of plums, blackberries and coffee. Grill up some spicy ribs and it will be just fine.",84,US,California,Malbec,25
74420,"Ripe blackberries, violet flowers, tobacco, mocha, smoke and asphalt swirl into an intriguing nose. Dense flavors of black cherries and kirsch are evened out by licorice, black tea and a pine-sap element that carries through the finish.",87,US,California,Syrah,20
5613,"Dry and bright in acidity, with a clean, silky mouthfeel. Shows fine raspberry and cherry fruit, with a squeeze of tangerine, leading to a spicy finish. Drink now with pork tenderloin, ahi tuna, roasted salmon.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
39183,"A light yet concentrated Pinot Noir, this has a cherry flavor and a spicy texture. Give it some air to allow the better side of its earthy aromas time to unravel.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,34
98463,"This is quite soft and pretty, a charming wine with appealing flavors of rose water, cherry and sandalwood. Not for keeping, but most enjoyable right now.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,18
82015,"This easy-to-love wine from the Michael Mondavi family has an obvious but attractive oaky character, from the abundant cedar and cinnamon aromas to the spicy nutmeg and cardamom flavors that bolster its red cherry fruit and medium body.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
132124,"Lots of upscale features in this polished Cab. It shows modern characteristics of expressively ripe, lush blackberry, blueberry, cassis and chocolate flavors that are wrapped in a soft, velvety texture. The softness may limit ageability.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
108297,"The star of the show among the three Libra wines tasted, this biodynamically-farmed offering is dark and exotic, with a range of scents from cherry liqueur to cinnamon, anise, and flowers. It breathes open into a perfumed and spicy wine, with accents of orange peel around substantial, brambly fruit.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,35
99636,"Righteous is a new budget label for Sweet Valley Winery. Mostly Merlot, this smooth, fruity red wine is ready to drink. It tastes like a latter-day version of the Hearty Burgundies of old, only with better fruit, and a hint of hazelnut in the finish.",86,US,Washington,Red Blend,12
4133,"Strawberries, red currants and root beer come out at first, with cherry soda bringing up the rear. This forward, fresh and fruity wine is drinking well right now, and should be consumed through 2019.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,55
87652,"A lovely wine, charming and complex. Shows how well this blend works for Eberle in Paso Robles, especially in a good vintage. Soft and lush, the wine is rich in blackberries and spices. Drinks well now, and should hold for some years.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,29
17069,"This Bordeaux blend has a different artist's label every year but otherwise has no identity of its own. This new release is tight, hot and shows signs of reduction; it's got a burnt rubber scent underlying the ultraripe, almost pruny fruit. It's just not a compelling wine; it hasn't jelled and it doesn't seem as if it will. There is concentration and power to be sure, but pleasure is in short supply.",85,US,Washington,Red Blend,48
138554,"The winery has had some success with this Spanish variety, but the '05 is not one of their best efforts. The wine is thinly structured and harsh in tannins, with exaggerratedly sweet cherry, cola and currant flavors.",82,US,California,Tempranillo,27
49041,"This is quite unusual, loaded with notes of green herb, leaf, fiddlehead fern, pepper and lemon verbena. It's herbal and not at all disagreeable, though fruit-lovers may want to look elsewhere. Just 50 cases of this wine were made.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,38
83136,"Sharp and cutting in acidity, with jammy, tutti-fruity blackberry and cherry flavors, this Cab is totally dry. It's ready to drink now.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
19026,"Powerful, mouthwatering, concentrated black-cherry and blackberry flavors form the core of this full-bodied, full-flavored and well-balanced wine. Starting with aromas of toasted oak and wood smoke, the wine has a broad rich mouthfeel and moderate tannins that propel the gorgeous fruit flavors across the palate and linger a long time on the finish.",93,US,California,Zinfandel,24
88458,"From one of Livermore's oldest producers, a small-production Petite Sirah, one of their specialties, all from an estate vineyard planted 40 years ago, this wine is super dark purple in color, very earthy, with nice chocolate and delicate fruit interspersed among the dusty tannins. Pretty and interesting.",87,US,California,Petite Sirah,25
117274,"Here you will find classic Bourbon barrel-vanilla flavors, but with bright, polished fruit showing through. This is firm and substantial—very clean winemaking—crisp, tight, polished and silky. Already it's showing layers of berries, currants and blueberries.",94,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,70
101447,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (40%), Merlot (35%), Syrah (22%) and Carmenère, this offers aromas of green tea, sawdust, blueberry and barnyard. The flavors are tangy and elegant in style.",82,US,Washington,Red Blend,19
106044,"Fruit flavors of pineapple and lemon are pushed forward, followed by a pleasing touch of light butter. The wine was barrel fermented in half new, half used oak. It's a fine spring/summer quaffer.",87,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,18
120903,"A rich, full-bodied and dry Syrah that shows fine terroir. It comes from an area, in the Gabilan Mountains of Monterey, that does not yet have a sub-appellation, but should. The wine is effusive in blackberries, black currants, mocha, pepper and cedar, with a sweetly exotic note of foie gras. Now–2012.",90,US,California,Syrah,29
35402,"Ripe and lush, this off-dry Gewürztraminer shows remarkable balance between its acidity and ripeness. It has abundant rose petal, spice and musk tones, and the exotic spice note intensifies on the midpalate, before extending toward the jasmine-tea-flavored finish.",88,US,New York,Gewürztraminer,20
19577,"All den Hoed grapes—barrel fermented, neutral oak, no malolactic. Very rich, deep and racy, with glorious fruit. Full-bodied and lush without being heavy; it keeps the freshness and minerality, along with a full range of fruits from citrus to stone fruits to melon. Finishes with a lick of white pepper.",93,US,Washington,Viognier,20
5318,"One of the deeper-colored rosés available, this memorable, medium-bodied wine bursts with fruity aromas and red wine-like flavors. It smells like cherries and apple skin and tastes fresh and brambly, as its generous texture fills the mouth with fruitiness that lasts through the finish.",90,US,California,Rosé,15
17041,"Fuzzy peach with a companionable co-host of Meyer lemon star in this medium-bodied, voluptuously appealing wine. It's balanced and easy to enjoy, its finish taking on added volume and likability.",90,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,26
55449,"This wine presents itself initially as having a bold, big body, yet is actually light on its feet as it opens, revealing aromas of cherry liqueur, rhubarb joined with a funk of black licorice and sassafras.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,55
26580,"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from an all-star collection of Walla Walla vineyards. It shows excellent structure and depth, with plenty of herbal character. The black fruits are abundant, spicy and sharp; this is a young wine from a great vintage than needs more bottle age. The layering, though still tight and compact, suggests that with cellaring this will evolve into Bordeaux-like complexity, with a mix of herb, mineral, leaf and berry flavors. The barrel flavors (40% new) are subtle and elegant.",93,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
138399,"How a Cab can be completely soft yet filled with power is a wonder, but this is such a wine. It's dry and dustily grippy in tannins, with a finely astringent finish, and will easily hold for a decade. If you must drink it now, a good steak will cut through the density and coax out the sweet cassis and cherry fruit.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,64
112008,"Cabernet Sauvignon gives this wine a luscious, elegant mouthfeel, with classic currant and cedar flavors. Syrah brings a gamy, leathery note, with white pepper accents. The result is an interesting, complex young wine of power and authority. Drink now.",92,US,California,Red Blend,52
31982,"This Yakima Valley Syrah definitely falls on the cool side of things. It's focused and pure-tasting, with strawberry compote as the dominant fruit. Some residual damp earth notes continue through the finish, with just a hint of bitterness.",87,US,Washington,Syrah,33
142852,"A “wow!” wine. Starts with a stupendous aroma that perfectly integrates toasty, caramelly oak with rich Indian pudding, gingerbread, sweet plum, cherry and spicy clove. The tannins are rich and ripe.",93,US,California,Syrah,35
124363,"There's weightiness to this big, bold, flavorful wine that exhibits concentrated berry and cherry cola that persist in a full-bodied way. Accents of minty earth and floral aromatics provide a hint of herb and lightness.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
148564,"Medium-ruby in color, with an inviting aroma of dried cherry, cinnamon, cola and smoky oak, this Pinot shows classic varietal structure and elegance. It's very, very dry, with a silky texture and penetrating acidity. Rather austere and angular now, the wine needs decanting or short-term aging.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
22290,"Intoxicating aromas of plum jelly, violets, blueberry, chocolate and cinnamon are cut with a pencil-lead focus on this bottling by a family in the Paso wine game since 1908. Flavors of blackberry jelly are lifted by lavender and anise spice.",92,US,California,Zinfandel,40
35168,"Savory tones of pressed apple and pear contrast with pretty orange-blossom aromas on this unusually light-footed Chardonnay. A blend of equal parts oak and stainless-steel ferment, it's concentrated with pear and lemon flavors. Finishes a bit short.",85,US,New York,Chardonnay,20
85167,"A dark color and big, brooding flavors make this wine bolder than most Pinots. The aromas are full of toasty, spicy oak, with more meaty, rich and almost earthy flavors that are very concentrated. With more sips, more complex accents of tea and forest floor add complexity.",94,US,California,Pinot Noir,82
78162,"Apple aromas and flavors characterize this medium-bodied wine. It tastes concentrated, focused, bracing and fresh. The texture is lean and crisp, with enough body to add some richness on the finish.",87,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,15
122207,"This is the winery's sweet sparkling wine. It has the elegant structure, fine acidity and forward raspberry, strawberry, lime, vanilla and smoke flavors of the dry bruts, with a sugary finish, for those who like their bubblies on the sweet side.",86,US,California,Sparkling Blend,15
41718,"Bright, fresh fruit and dried herb aromas combine with lively but concentrated and tannic fruit flavors in this big but well-behaved wine. The texture balances lavishness with a bit of astringency in an attractive and appetizing way.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,36
93222,"Soft and luscious, this has just enough tannin and acidity to give structure to the delicious black-cherry, cocoa and bacon flavors. Drink now.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
18756,"This vineyard select Pinot Noir shows some chocolate flavors around thin, sharp red berry fruit. The oak influence dominates, along with an earthy, tannic finish.",85,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,28
800,"With black cherry, blueberry, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction offsetting the light dill herbaceousness, this wine offers surprising depth for the affordable price. The texture is soft, yet the tannins stand up to the black cherry, charcoal and black-pepper flavors.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
44595,"High in acidity with a voluptuously sleek and supple body, this is a smoothly tamed wine. It's youthful and structured, with a mix of citrus, black cherry and cola. Medium bodied, it's memorably balanced and possesses subtle power.",95,US,California,Pinot Noir,70
128178,"Produced from the Sierra Foothills winery, Shenandoah, this is a dry, briary and rustic Cabernet. It has wild berry, currant and black pepper flavors, with edgy tannins. Needs rich beef and cheese dishes for balanced food pairing.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,24
143787,"Classic Cabernet, and ageworthy. Shows balanced blackberry, coffee, black olive, Provençal herb and oak flavors. It has complex tannins, and is very dry. This is not a long hangtime, superripe Cab, but strives for balance and elegance and succeeds. Best now–2016.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
56503,"The texture is off, with hard and bitter tannins. The fruit also is quite ripe, with the black cherries veering into raisins. Oak sticks out in the form of sweet vanilla and toast. The result lacks harmony.",83,US,California,Merlot,34
53179,"Made from 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc, it has every hallmark of a young Napa Valley Bordeaux blend. It's dry, smooth and complex in tannins, with balancing acidity and an incredible array of flavors, including blackberry, black currant, cherry, chocolate, dried herb, smoky oak and spice. It has that important but hard-to-define quality of sophistication. It's delicious now, and it should develop in the bottle for at least 10 years.",95,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,115
52273,"Black in color, glyceriney. Massive, deep, tremendous. Some will find it overpowering in New World extraction, but it's a real beauty in that style. Explodes in black currants, chocolate and new oak, almost overripe, with suggestions of raisins. Almost dessert-like, but stays dry and elegant. Defines modern Napa Valley cult Cabernet Sauvignon.",95,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,175
52491,"Cranberry, spice and fresh herb give this peppery Pinot plenty of flavor interest. Definitely on the earthy and herbal side, this juicy wine is a good go-to bottle for everyday drinking.",86,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,17
82129,"There's a touch of crushed ant aroma on the nose of this wine from an old Paso vineyard, which also also gives scents of ripe stone fruit, lime pith and dill. Once sipped, a pear juice flavor dominates along with a lime juice-on-nectarine element that adds a sour twist.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,40
35064,"Essentially a Cabernet Franc with Merlot and Sangiovese in the blend, this easy-drinking red wine feels a bit generic. One-dimensional berry and pale cherry fruit flavors quickly fade into light tannins.",83,US,Washington,Red Blend,18
108396,"Steven Kent Mirassou is practically single-handedly reviving Livemore Valley's historic reputation for Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine shows a wonderfully lush structure and impeccable tannins, framing slightly herbal, dusty flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cherries and cedar. Really fine, and a superb accompaniment for rich meats and cheeses.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
129510,"Gets the Merlot basics done by being dry and medium-bodied, with everyday cherry, red currant, herb and oak flavors.",83,US,California,Merlot,7
132463,"This wine shows the California influence, taking the edges off the Oregon fruit and pushing it forward on the palate. Broad flavors of strawberry jam and streaks of melon take over, with plenty of the root beer/cola character right behind. It could almost be Russian River juice, but shown in a lighter, more elegant style. Excellent value.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,19
82990,"This is hot in alcohol, and it has a vegetal note, with modest berry fruit. The finish seems sweet—like cola.",81,US,California,Zinfandel,29
106221,"This is a best barrel blend of Goldeneye's several vineyards. It takes its beautifully ripe fruit from Confluence and the tannins of The Narrows to yield a dry, densely constructed and moderately ageable wine of exceptionally high quality and appeal. Blackberries, blueberries, cherries and exotic spices characterize the flavors of this tremendous wine, one of the best of the vintage out of the Anderson Valley. Only 222 cases were produced.",98,US,California,Pinot Noir,100
147906,"This Napa stalwart is beautifully integrated. Leesy and citrus notes accent the solid apple and toast profile on both the nose and in the mouth. It's big, but displays impeccable balance and a great mouthfeel. Lime and spice play against richer butterscotch, vanilla and toasty elements on the long, handsomely textured finish.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,45
33633,"This precisely crafted wine lifts Carneros Chardonnay to a whole new level. Yes, it's pricey, but so complex and decadent, it's worth it. The alcohol is refreshingly low, the acidity is bright, and there's a lick of steel to balance the nectarine and mango fruit, buttered-toast and cream flavors.",93,US,California,Chardonnay,50
68587,"Rich and dramatic, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah offers smooth, unctuous flavors of cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and pepper. It's a seductively appealing wine, with thick, refined tannins and a dry finish. Should gain in the bottle over the next 4–6 years. Great price for the quality.",91,US,California,Red Blend,20
118101,"A nice bubbly that's mainly Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It shows Champagne flavors suggesting citrus fruits, pears, strawberries and bread, with crisp acidity making the finish clean. The mouthfeel is a little rough and scoury.",87,US,California,Sparkling Blend,50
97410,"The producer's smallest-production red from the vintage, and its fourth bottling from the east-sloping blocks of its estate vineyard, this wine is full and lush on the palate, yet elegantly crafted to reveal pine forest, grenadine and a persistence of floral and herbal notes. Smooth and integrated, it presents a rose garden's worth of beauty that lingers on the finish.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,90
80046,"Crisp boysenberry and black raspberry aromas meet with lthyme, oregano and a touch of caramelization on the nose of this Sea Smoke bottling. Dark cranberry fruit shows on the palate, lifted by anise, pepper and an array of herbs, all framed by a leathery texture. Drink now until 2028.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
66232,"Hot gravel and blackberry fruit combine for straightforward, light-on-the-feet aromas on this bottling from a small estate near Happy Canyon. Cherry and blackberry pie flavors show on the palate, with tart, fresh berries framed by a buttery crust.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,34
145769,"A rich, balanced Cab-based blend of all 5 classic Bordeaux varietals. Understated and elegant, polished and fruity. Feels harmonious and balanced through the finish.",90,US,California,Meritage,35
44563,"This well-balanced, estate-grown Pinot Noir combines elegance with accessibility. It's a lovely mix of flower and red berry scents and flavors. A hint of rose petal adds a gentle touch to the finish.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,37
31314,"This interesting blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Charbono and Cabernet Franc is a big wine packed with powerful black currant and licorice flavors, with a liberal dusting of pepper. It impresses for dryness and the rich, sturdy tannins. Drink this rustically chic wine with roasts.",90,US,California,Red Blend,32
60860,"There's a reason few wineries nowadays produce Barbera. It's a boring wine, and just because it comes from as fine a producer as Reverie can't change that fact. The wine is dry, tannic and dull, with unevenly ripened flavors.",82,US,California,Barbera,50
46253,"Dark, bone dry and very tannic, this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend has a fine structure. In the mouth it feels rich and earthy, but offers fruitier flavors of currants, limned in sweet, smoky oak. Very Bordeaux-esque.",91,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,25
14497,"This blend is 50% Mourvèdre, 25% Grenache and 25% Syrah, with leather, herb and earth tones on the bouquet and palate. The fruit was sourced entirely from the relatively cool Stillwater Creek Vineyard. An excellent, balanced composition.",90,US,Washington,G-S-M,40
112741,"Layered on both the nose and palate, this standout Finger Lakes Pinot is tart and fresh, yet full with concentrated sour cherry and red plum flavors. Firmly structured with bright acidity and a delightful spray of violet perfume on the finish.",88,US,New York,Pinot Noir,26
2497,"A really good wine for the price, this offers a dark color and varietal aromas of black cherry, black olive and faint dried herbs. Next it layers handsome oak on the rich and fruity flavors. The texture is quite dense without being heavy; while somewhat tannic the mouthfeel is not drying.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,10
112373,"This Syrah is overripe. It has a taste of raisins and prunes­—a baked, Porty quality—like the grapes had been grilled before being made into wine.",81,US,California,Syrah,25
40937,"Thin and raw, and slightly sweet, this is not a very satisfying Cab. It tastes like candied blackberry and cherry LifeSavers.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
24028,"White blossoms and fresh green herbs perfume this full-bodied wine. Dry in style and refreshingly tart, it finishes briskly with a bit of floral flair.",87,US,New York,Pinot Grigio,17
31954,"This has lovely and deep black fruits, with smoke and toast from the barrel aging. There's a streak of caramel and a hint of coconut, good balance and length, and less obvious burn and astringency than the more recent vintages.",93,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,42
54108,"The 2006 was really good, but the 2007 is a disappointment. Where that wine was complex, this is simple, tasting of watermelon, cotton candy and LifeSaver cherry flavors that finish watery and sugary.",83,US,California,Pinot Noir,22
107250,"A blend of various varieties, this red has a rustic feeling in the gritty tannins and briary flavors of wild berries and Asian spices. But it's not a simple wine. It's actually quite satisying in the way it floods the mouth with flavor, then finishes in a dry way that welcomes grilled meats, hard cheeses, olive oil and tomato sauce.",88,US,California,Red Blend,20
9883,"Merlot (39%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (24%), Malbec (15%), Petit Verdot (10%), Petite Sirah (6%) and Carménère. Scents of barrel spice, dark fruit, vanilla and herb are followed by cranberry and cherry flavors, speckled with barrel spices. Grainy tannins provide support.",88,US,Washington,Red Blend,31
5633,"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but it's fun and delicious and utterly unique, in its own high mountain way. Completely dry, the flavors are of blackberries cooked into a pie and black pepper, with just a hint of raisins.",90,US,California,Zinfandel,29
105206,"Ripe, briary aromas of wild berries, plums and earth veer into dark chocolate. Flavors are on the light side, and seem a little soft. An affordable everyday wine to serve at picnics. Don’t be misled by the “Home Ranch” description; this is not an estate wine.",82,US,California,Zinfandel,9
105173,"This is a great example of a lower alcohol, somewhat underripe Pinot Noir that shows solid depth and lovable freshness. Lively aromas of black-raspberry sorbet and dark strawberry show on the nose, while the palate picks up a tart cranberry character. White pepper, thyme and juniper enliven the fruity flavors.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
115597,"Surprisingly dark for Tempranillo, this ripe and fruity wine has hints of barn and straw in the nose. The concentrated cherry/berry fruit flavors roll into drying tannins, with some seed tannin bitterness.",86,US,Washington,Tempranillo,30
94758,"Despite coming from declassified barrels from the winery's other programs, the quality still hits a very high mark on this blend of Cabernet Franc (33%), Cabernet Sauvignon (29%), Merlot (29%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas of cranberry, herbs, plum and mineral are generous followed by good depth to the fruit flavors and bitters on the finish. As always with this winery, it's the balance of acid and tannins that most impresses. Give a one hour decant.",92,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,25
83063,"This has flavors and aromas of hazelnut, dried apricot and coconut in between layers of lush white peach. Overall, this is very pretty and well balanced. Its light-handed finish is floral and tropical, without a sign of oak.",88,US,California,Viognier,20
52403,"The aromas are vibrant, with notes of flowers, jasmine, lime and peach. The palate drinks a hair off dry, with the concentration coming off as light but still providing interest.",87,US,Washington,Riesling,26
57723,"Elegance and finesse are the touchstones here, with the scaffolding to age for decades. Tight and precise, it shows pomegranate and red-berry fruit, stiff and potent tannins, and plenty of supporting acidity. Drink 2020 to 2030 and beyond.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,54
4936,"Defines a certain style of Paso Robles red wine, soft in structure, with easy, gentle tannins and ripe, pronounced fruit that's almost candied in sweetness. But in this case, the blackberry and cherry flavors are totally dry.",86,US,California,Syrah,20
136833,"It's hard to find good Washington Malbec under $20. Start here. Stone Tree (Wahluke Slope) vineyard provided much of the fruit, and there is a small (10%) amount of new oak in the mix. This captures the steely core of cassis, matches it to sharp, defining acids, and hones the accents of herb and cinnamon spice to a perfect pitch.",90,US,Washington,Malbec,20
99172,"This wine is made by Paso Robles-based Jeremy Weintraub, who also works at Adelaida Winery. Aromas recall beeswax, light banana, ripe nectarine, lemon curd and white flowers. Soft once sipped, it proves easy to drink, with flavors of chamomile tea, yellow pear, yellow apples and roasted nuts.",90,US,California,Roussanne,40
65928,"This vineyard selection brings a bit more concentration and complexity than the other Coelho Pinots. The mixed fruits offer flavors of red candy and Orange Crush, with a touch of the region's earthy tannins. Just 20% went into new oak.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
129008,"Soft, easy and dry, with a silky texture framing flavors of rosehip tea, cherry skins, cranberries and pepper. Drink now.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,20
118128,"This brings a pleasing mix of apple, melon and peach fruit, with a good grip and moderate length. It's a fine all-purpose Oregon Chardonnay, widely available at a wallet-friendly price.",88,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,14
127077,"This Bordeaux-style blend, using the old-fashioned term Claret, may be a sly indication of its age, drinkability and overall balance. Scents of sandalwood, musk and black cherry greet you, with maturing flavors of ripe cherries and cigar box. Supple and seamless, with impeccable balance, it's now drinking at its best.",92,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,37
63494,"The wine is tart and pretty thin in citrus and peach fruit, leaving the oak to stick out. Still, it does show fine elegance and minerality.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,27
81252,"Lots of fun to sip this showy, overt, no-holds-barred Zin. Lavish use of new oak gives aromas of toasted bread, maple syrup and smoked bacon. The flavors say ripe strawberries and sweet blackberry jam, and the finish is sweet and spicy at the same time.",89,US,California,Zinfandel,12
16296,"This is a blend of several vineyards, instead of the winery's usual single-vineyard Chards. It's been tastefully assembled, and displays good Central Coast acidity framing tropical fruit and oak flavors with a stony, minerally edge.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,30
112029,"Rich in jammy cherry and chocolate flavors, and with finely ground, ripe tannins, this Merlot hails from an inland Sonoma County appellation. The wine is a little simple, but is elegant and very easy to drink.",84,US,California,Merlot,17
68558,"This pleasant Merlot is a little tough and gritty, but it's rich and candied in blackberry and cherry, roasted almond and vanilla flavors. Give it some time to breathe in the glass.",86,US,California,Merlot,21
122772,"A rustic tinge of barnyard-y earth marks this wine, otherwise plumed in plum and tobacco. Its personality leans toward herbaceousness, with a juiciness on the midpalate. The finish is dry and abbreviated.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
5459,"This Virginia Cab Franc starts soft and ripe with loads of juicy black currant and berry flavors flecked with sweet, warm baking spices and cedar notes. A zesty kick of acidity on the midpalate and a flash of fresh, green herbs on the finish add elegance and balance.",88,US,Virginia,Cabernet Franc,29
51230,"Lots of dry elegance in this wine. It's also more acidic than your typical Napa Cabernet, with a tart bite. The tannins are young and forceful, and the finish is totally dry. As presently constituted, it's somewhat tough and lean. But the core of cherries and blackberries suggests some degree of ageabilty. Hold until 2015.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
46224,"Char and savory spices accent blackberry and cherry aromas on this crisp, medium-bodied wine. On the palate, delicate fruit flavors are a bit overwhelmed amidst layers of oak and spice. It ends with a soft kiss of tannins.",85,US,New York,Pinot Noir,35
61729,"This proves that sparkling wine does not have to be bone-dry to be sophisticated. Although moderately sweet, it is complex in aroma, elegant in texture and balance, rich in flavor and long on the finish. An appealing fresh-bread aroma leads to rich poached-pear flavors. This will be great with an after-dinner cheese course.",93,US,California,Sparkling Blend,39
103599,"A kitchen-sink blend of varieties with Merlot (44%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (26%) taking the lead, this wine offers appealing aromas that suggest high-toned, sweet barrel spices, plum and herbs. It's loaded with cranberry, cherry and plum flavors with a rich mouthfeel that keeps the interest high.",91,US,Washington,Red Blend,18
39110,"This brooding, brawny wine made from mountain fruit is all about mushroom and compost notes—a true expression of the vineyard's surroundings. Black cherry fruit and youthful tannins provide context, with a sizzling streak of acidity.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
10197,"A solid effort from this fine winery, from a vintage everyone is increasingly admitting was more difficult than it looked. It’s as middle of the road as you can get. It strikes all the right notes in terms of ripe, polished black-currant fruit, anise and smoky oak, yet never quite achieves complexity. Nonetheless there’s enough harmony and juiciness to satisfy.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
118925,"This is the first wine made from Oregon grapes by this southern California winery. But one can't help but wonder if shipping fruit all the way down the coast might bang it up a bit. For whatever reason, this wine tastes fractured, metallic and chalky. There is a core of black cherry, but it seems surrounded by gun-metal flavors, which stick to the palate and abruptly shut down the finish.",85,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
139827,"This is pure varietal, all from the estate vineyard, and already showing the warm, round supple strength of great Washington Merlot. Rich and sweetly ripe with spicy berries, wild red fruits and sweet chocolate.",91,US,Washington,Merlot,25
118762,"Spicy and completely dry, this fresh and fruity rosé is a pretty strawberry and salmon shade, with persistent flavors of cherry candy, lemon oil and nougat. There's a nice citrus snap to the finish.",88,US,Washington,Sangiovese,13
78039,"Nice blackberry, mocha, teriyaki beef and pepper flavors in this dry, smoothly tannic wine. It's too soft to show development in the bottle, but is pretty good for drinking now.",86,US,California,Syrah,24
35843,"The vineyard is located in the Chehalem Mountain AVA (not shown on the label) and reflects the dark, earthy characteristics of the region. Fruit is spicy, tart and tightly wound, mixing black raspberry, black cherry and a sip of Dr Pepper. That blackness continues with some licorice threading through the finish.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,55
33684,"Spritzy, lively and quite dry, this mixes citrus rind phenolics with apple and pear fruit. It's simple, fruity and searingly tart.",86,US,Washington,Riesling,19
141667,"Straightforward black berry and black cherry over dark, chocolaty tannins. Simple, astringent and a bit stripped.",86,US,Washington,Merlot,36
25116,"Whispers of smoke and petrol meld into wild heather honey notes on Heron Hill's richly concentrated semidry Riesling. While abundantly floral and fruity, penetrating acidity maintains balance and structure. Finishes dry, with a deliciously bitter grapefruit-pith note.",88,US,New York,Riesling,14
61424,"Generous in toasty oak aromas this Cab is otherwise rich in tar and black jam, its flavors muted by the overwhelming taste of wood.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,10
30772,"An outstanding Reserve, this opens with potent aromas of spice and cacao, which lead onto a muscular, sleek and stylish palate that shows terrific depth of black fruits. The wine has exceptional structure, and it remains nuanced, with details of earth and stem.",92,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
113171,"This is an easy-drinking Pinot Gris, with light melon and pear fruit. It's well-balanced and lively, with modest concentration.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,20
17649,"Soft and one-dimensional, with a silky texture and modest flavors of cherries, cola, sassafras and spices.",83,US,California,Pinot Noir,18
84864,"Tangerine peel and citrus blossom are fragrant and fresh on this flirtatious off-dry Riesling. Straightforward and juicy in style, the palate is saturated with peach and apricot nectar. Zesty lime and touches of mineral add lift to the finish.",88,US,New York,Riesling,14
72251,"About one-third was fermented in neutral oak, the rest in stainless steel, yielding a rich and smooth wine loaded with fresh flavors of pear and nectarine fruits. There's a tasty pie crust toastiness also, and the lingering finish has you reaching for the next sip.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Blanc,22
11196,"There is a lot of Central Coast scrub on the nose of this bottling, with anise and sagebrush spicing up the ripe red cherry and rounded strawberry notes. It's light in body, with loads of dried herb, red plum and tart strawberry flavors, proving easy to drink, with compelling acidity.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,38
107968,"A difficult wine to assess. It's so ripe and forward in sweet cherry jam and smoky, caramelized oak that it seems like a mere fruit bomb at first sip. But something about the structure goes well beyond simplicity. Could develop bottle complexity over the years, but it's unpredictable.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,38
73643,"Shows enormously extracted black cherry and mocha flavors, a testament to how nicely ripe the difficult Grenache variety got in the winery's Rodney's Vineyard. Oak lurks in the background, giving smoky, buttery notes.",87,US,California,Grenache,30
78014,"Off-the-charts alcohol notwithstanding, this massive wine will surely please those who like their reds big, dense and deep. It's principally Grenache, packed with pure fruit flavors of cassis and blackberry compote. It retains sufficient acidity to keep it buoyant. Tannins are tongue scrapers, bone dry and astringent. This is best sipped solo, or perhaps with a really juicy, fat-laden steak.",91,US,Oregon,Red Blend,38
109264,"This is an off-dry, fruity style, bringing luscious pear, orange, golden apple and citrus flavors to the front. There's a hint of orange marmalade, and it has good weight and concentration, along with lovely purity of flavor, right through the finish. You'll be reaching for that next glass before you know it.",88,US,Washington,Gewürztraminer,11
91500,"From a newish, small producer that's worth keeping an eye on, this wine is earthy and slightly cloudy, balanced in nature. Wild strawberry and cranberry are pitted smoothly against firm, medium-bodied tannins and oak. The finish is crisp and juicy.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
131839,"Kudos to the winery for picking at low brix and for keeping the residual sugar so low so that the wine is absolutely dry. It lets the palate really appreciate the acid-brightened flavors of exotic fruits, wildflowers, and, especially, Asian spices. The wine could be more concentrated, but it's still a good sipper.",88,US,California,Gewürztraminer,25
33968,"A highly aromatic and expressive wine, this explodes with scents of baked pineapple, ruby grapefruit, tangerine and apricot preserves. Fleshy, concentrated and focused, the palate has plenty of animated acidity. The flavor intensity is solid on the medium-to-long finish, ending with a touch of warmth.",88,US,New Mexico,Viognier,20
119507,"This blend of multiple varieties, some of them rare in California, can be described as rustic. It's dry, tannic and moderate in alcohol, with pretty cherry, red currant and pepper flavors. Needs food, especially cheese, to tame it.",86,US,California,Red Blend,45
105074,"Elegant aromas of blackcurrant and black cassis combine with German-chocolate cake and concentrated violet oil scents on the nose of this bottling. It is soft and full on the palate, where mouth-coating tannins present flavors of earthy loam, black cherry and hint of burnt caramel on the finish.",89,US,California,Petite Sirah,30
26968,"Impresses for the sheer volume of fruit, offering waves of pie filling raspberries, cherries and red currants, with notes of cocoa, bacon, sweet oak and savory spices. A good bite of Central Coast acidity fortunately brings briskness to the richness. Drink now–2012.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,44
38975,"Enormously fruity and ripe, this Cab explodes with blackberry, blueberry, currant, and chocolate flavors that can only develop in a warm region. Yet there's enough of an acid-tannin structure to give it balance. Try pairing with steak with a gorgonzola cream sauce.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,84
139982,"Nice now at 5–plus years in the bottle, with fully resolved tannins making the wine softly creamy in the mouth. The fruit is beginning to fall out, leaving a dry herbaceousness to the departing blackberries and cherries, which are fusing with the sweet vanillins of oak. Shows real elegance of structure, but it's all downhill from here, so drink up.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,48
90493,"Leathery on the tongue, this lovely Merlot, with 7% Cabernet Sauvignon blended in, offers inviting notes of plum and cherry, completely juicy, around firm, strong tannins and balanced acidity. From two separate, rocky blocks on the winery property, this wine is concentrated and smooth. Enjoy through 2021–2025.",93,US,California,Merlot,60
118680,"This is a simple, sweetly fruity wine, more Shiraz than Syrah, with jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors. Napa brings ripeness, while Monterey brings acidity. Drink up.",83,US,California,Syrah,20
14389,"Cabernet Franc (54%) takes the lead on this blend, with the balance Merlot (29%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas of flower, barrel spice and herb are light, with slightly dried-out raspberry and cherry notes lurking in the background. It also has a medicinal top note. Flavors are super-smooth and palate-coating, finishing sweet.",89,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,25
38762,"Dry and rather scoury, with a rough mouthfeel. But it's clean and bone dry, and shows proper sparkling wine flavors of citrus, vanilla, yeast and green apple.",86,US,California,Sparkling Blend,19
9368,"This is the least successful Judd's Hill Cabernet in recent memory. The current '04 bottling is lean, with cherry tea and mint flavors. A disappointment.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,42
26573,"Reserved aromas of vanilla, pickling spices and cherry are followed by light cranberry flavors with the concentration wanting.",86,US,Washington,Tempranillo,30
49523,"Rapidly maturing, with some brick coloring and secondary fruit flavors of prune and raisin. Drinking nicely, and quite delicious. Along with the smooth fruit you get smoke, dust, cocoa and a hint of caramelized sugar.",90,US,Washington,Merlot,30
107824,"A yellowish salmon in color, this wine shows hints of watermelon, bubble gum and cotton candy in the light and pleasantly uncomplicated nose. There is great energy on the palate, with more focus on a steely, metallic texture rather than ripe flavors, proving fresh, bright and quick on the sip.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,23
128022,"Dry, ripe and exotic. Made from the Musqué clone, it shows melon, lime, mineral and white pepper flavors, with a touch of New Zealand-style gooseberry, brightened with crisp acidity. There are some green, feline notes that will make the wine controversial. Tasted twice.",86,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,27
17447,"This is already quite soft, oxidized and mature. It's a pleasant take on Sangiovese, absolutely ready to drink and approachable with warm, raisiny fruit flavors. There's a soft, chocolaty landing that keeps the tannins easy also. But there's not much character and no real stuffing here.",85,US,Washington,Sangiovese,15
91019,"Talley's basic estate Pinot can be good, and it can be ordinary. The '06 is pretty tannic and direct. It's a hard, tough wine that's not particularly lush, although it's clean and properly varietal. You'll find cherry and currant flavors that veer into raisins.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,36
128818,"Richly fruity and semisweet, this medium-bodied wine smells like cotton candy and tastes like pear syrup. Smooth in texture and mouth-filling in concentration, it finishes on lingering sweetness.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,12
96312,"There's a strong menthol, juniper and pine needle kick to the nose of this bottling, alongside intriguing green tea and tart plum-skin aromas. Eucalyptus oil leads the lively herbal kick of the palate, giving intense depth to the hearty black-plum and tobacco flavors, all framed by a fresh acidity.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
33314,"Fresh pear, white peach and fig aromas, a rich texture, and generous vanilla and layered almond flavors describe this tasty wine that stays fresh and fruity through the finish. It offers a medium body and nice balance.",88,US,California,Viognier,25
64210,"Rough in texture, with a briary, scoury mouthfeel that emphasizes the fruitiness, giving it a candied sweetness. The tannins seem unbalanced. Lacks Napa Valley elegance, especially at this price.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,48
129582,"A blend of 60% Montepulciano and 40% Sangiovese, this is a grippy, leathery wine, the fruit sourced from two different sites in the appellation. Black leather, baked and dried plum, and cherry combine on the palate with breadth and length, finishing as if dusted in cocoa.",90,US,California,Red Blend,38
20528,"Aromas of prunes and figs introduce a big, thick, chewy Cabernet with plenty of fruit power. Black raspberry, black cherry and black currant fruits swirl through layers of smoky wood. Tannins are quite astringent and drying.",89,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
101550,"Warm red-cherry aromas meet with light hints of sage and leather on the very shy nose of this bottling from one of the region's larger growers. The flavors are also light and rustic, with tart cranberry and hints of leather and game.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,36
75907,"Racy and sleek, this low-alcohol Pinot has a silky transparency that makes it feel just fine in the mouth. The raspberry and cola flavors have a nice hint of smoky oak. Drink now.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
50140,"Pure varietal, with alcohol around 13.5%—typical for Robert Karl reds. Smooth entry, rich fruit and excellent structure. Bright cherry flavors dominate, gliding smoothly through a pretty midpalate into the tannins. The tannins just barely hint at an herbal underpinning, but are plenty ripe.",90,US,Washington,Merlot,22
10985,"Dried strawberries, saddle leather, crushed violets and a hint of maple make for a fairly straightforward yet appealing nose on this wine. Pomegranate, raspberries and purple florals show on the palate, but the tannic structure still is a bit wound up, and will unfold into more anise and sage in years to come. Drink 2018–2024.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,46
50028,"This reserve wine is a four grape, Bordeaux-style blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon holding the principal spot. The flavors are diffuse, lightly herbal and peppery, with little concentration or definition.",85,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,49
48415,"A simple, fruity wine, with cherry, cola, cocoa and spice flavors, wrapped into gentle tannins and cut with a bite of acidity. Easy to drink with meats, cheeses, tomato-sauced pasta.",85,US,California,Sangiovese,14
82975,"You'll find some good cherry, vanilla, cola and sandalwood flavors in this dry Pinot Noir. It's on the light side, but is modest in alcohol, with an elegant mouthfeel.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,25
73288,"Ripe tropical fruit and oak dominate this overly sweet Chardonnay. It's very rich in pineapple tart, golden mango, buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors, but lacks dry balance. Tastes like there's a lot of white sugar in there.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,32
68229,"Tropical, thick and decidedly rich, this wine is both balanced and luxuriously fleshy, with highlights of peach, pineapple, Gravenstein apple and vanilla-kissed caramel. Full bodied, it'll still sing at the table.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,32
105444,A sugary Chardonnay whose main attraction is its honey flavor. That gives a dessert wine sweetness to the pineapple and lemon fruit. Ready now.,84,US,California,Chardonnay,30
106083,"Tank fermented, then aged in neutral French oak, this has a tawny cast to it and a soft, slightly woody flavor. The lemony flavor finishes with a mildly bitter fruit-skin note.",85,US,Washington,Viognier,24
13697,"Underneath the oak is a modest, crisp Pinot Noir, dry and appealing in raspberry, cherry, cola and mushroom flavors. The oak is a little heavy-handed, though, making the wine feel heavy and finish sweet.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,20
65521,"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,28
44658,"The Indelicato family's vineyard is basically the entire appellation. This hearty blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petit Verdot and Viognier shows it off well, with fruit-driven aromas of grape juice, grape seeds, olallieberries and sandalwood. The palate shows decent structure as well as blackberry fruit, dried oregano, beef jerky, peppercorn and sanguine flavors.",90,US,California,Red Blend,30
88715,"A beautiful rosé sparkling wine, one that shows loads of finesse and elegance. But the final word is its deliciousness. Really captivates with subtle raspberry, toast, vanilla and yeasty brioche flavors that finish so crisp and clean.",90,US,California,Sparkling Blend,27
53669,"Soft, round and textured, this is a minty Zinfandel with a pronounced jolt of smoke on the long finish.",85,US,California,Zinfandel,14
40550,"This is an equal split of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Medium bodied, it's peppery in cassis, cedar, cinnamon and vanilla. Big, pillowy tannins fill the palate, staying firm and sizable through the finish.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,95
59506,"An unusual earthy, herbal character dominates the mild fruitiness and marzipan character of this medium-bodied, slightly sweet wine.",83,US,California,White Blend,23
66468,"Delivers just what consumers want in a Viognier, namely, vibrantly exotic and powerful fruity flavor. Mangoes, papayas, anything your heart desires can be found, in a rich, dry, creamy texture. White chocolate even shows up in the long, delicious finish.",90,US,California,Viognier,22
40453,"A soft, gentle Zinfandel, a little sweet, like a raspberry and cherry mocha drink sprinkled with cocoa and cinnamon. Easy to drink with spicy meats, soft cheeses, everyday fare.",85,US,California,Zinfandel,16
126918,"Could be a Pinot Grigio, with a flowery, honeysuckle note along with the lemons, limes, pineapples and vanilla. Whatever, it's a crisp, dry and likeable white wine.",87,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,19
84578,"Rajat Parr's single-vineyard expression may be the priciest white wine in the region, but it does impress, with aromas of lemon curd, limestone and macadamia-nut mousse. There's just the right combination of oak, fruit and acid on the palate, with flavors of sea salt, yellow flowers and a pinch of cinnamon.",94,US,California,Chardonnay,90
63586,"This wine has a texture of softness and juiciness, with a leathery background. Tannic and rich in blackberry and powerful oak, it finishes lean.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,58
6197,"This 100% varietal wine leads with woodspice, green herb and flower aromas and follows with sweet, vanilla-laced black fruit flavors. Although aged entirely in used French oak, the barrel influence is prominent. The tannins bring dryness, needing food to ease their grit.",87,US,Washington,Petit Verdot,30
84091,"Smoke and dark chocolate notes abound on this elegant Long Island Merlot (made with 10% Petit Verdot). A touch austere on the palate, it has a black plum flavor shaded with hints of resin, leaves and game. Bold tannins add structure and power.",86,US,New York,Merlot,30
92914,"This wine is half Funk Estate Vineyard Syrah, with the rest McClellan Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The two varieties somewhat seem to cancel each other out initially, with aromas of smoked meat, cherry, herb and earth that don't seem fully resolved. The palate brings a smooth, elegant styling to the red and blue-fruit flavors. There's plenty of interest, but it doesn't all entirely come together at present.",89,US,Washington,Red Blend,55
76375,"Made by Carabella, this popular budget Pinot sports solid, country flavors. Plenty of bright, vivid and tart fruit—berries and cherries—give it a full-bodied, forward expression. But it's not all front-loaded; there is surprising depth, and overall a fine balance.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,20
145965,"Deep berry, cinnamon, briar and mint aromas. Firm, even backwards, it is trim and elegant, yet solid. Black fruit and bitter-chocolate flavors abound. The finish is especially tight, with dry tannins and complex mineral and earth elements. Huge but refined, the quintessential iron fist in a velvet glove; it needs time.",93,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,100
102970,"This is dry, with scouring tannins and some twiggy, stalky bitterness. It has just enough blackberry flavor to get by. For the price, it's fine for big parties.",83,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,8
10280,"Aromas are mildly floral, fresh and fruity and the flavors are sweet and mouthfilling. This could be a cocktail wine for people with sweet tooths or something to go with dessert.",83,US,California,Moscato,25
99825,"The pedigree of this Syrah is top-notch. The vineyard was planted by one of the owners of the fine Cabernet house, Surh Luchtel, and one of the winery's co-owners works at the von Strasser winery. The wine itself shows promise, but is a little too ripe and sweet for comfort, with jammy, stewed blackberry, cherry and cola flavors that have been well-oaked.",86,US,California,Syrah,30
106326,"This is 100% Barbera, from the Milbrandt Northridge vineyard in the Wahluke Slope. Tight, tart, acidic and vanilla-streaked, it seems at once unripe and over-ripe. Barbera in Washington remains a bit of an experiment.",85,US,Washington,Barbera,15
49701,"Charred strawberries and very ripe cranberry sauce make for a very compelling nose on this rare single varietal bottling of this lighter Rhône red. It's full and light on the palate, with tanned leather, sandalwood and more spiced strawberry. A very nice change of pace from the region's big reds and good way to impress wine geek friends.",91,US,California,Counoise,40
79075,"This Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre blend has a tart and tangy appeal. The mixed plum and berry fruit flavors are matched with strongly herbal streaks. Tannins are earthy and astringent.",87,US,Washington,Rhône-style Red Blend,32
122272,"If you're looking for a supersweet, Sauternes-style dessert wine that feels clean, this late-harvest Viognier fits the bill. It's absolutely decadent in honeyed apricot, pineapple, crème brûlée and vanilla fudge flavors that are balanced with crisp acidity.",93,US,California,Viognier,30
66825,"Besides the Malbec, there is also 12% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. The grapes are from the Gold Vineyards in the Rogue Valley. Aged 13 months in French oak, it's showing a big burst of vanilla in both nose and flavor, along with cranberry fruit and some rugged dusty tannins. Another year of bottle age would help to integrate the oak a bit further.",87,US,Oregon,Malbec,26
122209,"This bottling has been variable over the years, and the '04 is not showing it at its best. It's a good but not a great Cabernet, ripe and a little sweet in cassis and cherry flavors, backed up with firm, dry tannins. Drink now.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
63753,"Like the label says, this is an everyday sort of wine. It's crisp in acids and off-dry, with pleasant orange, pineapple, lemon and vanilla flavors.",84,US,California,White Blend,15
32648,"This wine is made from a single clone grown in a single vineyard, then aged sur lees in French barrels. It starts with a complex bouquet perfumed like a Gewürztraminer, the palate crisp and lowly impacted by oak.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,32
95687,"Tasting mature and mellow, this deceptively full-bodied wine has sun-baked aromas, prune and dried-cherry flavors, and a smooth texture. It's lightly tart on the finish.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,26
88674,"A full hit of blackberry and black cherry kick things off right in this Lodi Barbera, followed by flavors of Dr. Pepper-like spice and chocolate, with a silky, smooth finish. This lovely wine would be happy served alongside a heaping plate of lightly herbed, red-sauced pasta and pizza.",88,US,California,Barbera,18
41724,"Subtlety and a savory quality help this wine stand out from the rest of the Goldeneye lineup. It has meaty, slightly peppery aromas along with subtle cherry scents, a plush, almost soft texture and delicious, moderately ripe flavors like pomegranate and black cherry.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,82
138525,"A very pale wine, barely more than a rosé in hue, but very flavorful. Enraptures the palate with vanilla-scented raspberry Newton, orange biscotti, cola, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors that swirl into a long, spicy finish. Not an ager, but perfect now with grilled salmon or a fine ham.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
147912,"This is a seductive pleasure-bomb, with a ripe core of tropical, citrus and banana fruit flavors wrapped in a toasty-oak and butterscotch cocoon. Lush and creamy, it hits all the right notes; as it pushes the ripeness and vanilla envelopes to the max, it does so with great style and balance. The long, toasty, crème brûlée finish has great appeal. Top Value.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,30
20928,"Made in a big, overripe, soft and slightly sweet style, this will appeal to fans who like a more flamboyant Zinfandel. It's very ripe in berry jam, orange pekoe tea, cola and spice flavors. Almost a food group in itself. Drink with powerful, rich fare, such as spicy Vietnamese beef, Mexican tamales and tacos, or good old rubbed beef barbecue.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,50
40584,"This wine is 100% varietal, all aged in once-used French oak. It's packed to the brim with black fruit, herbs, licorice, jalapeño pepper and barrel spices, with crystalline clarity to the aromas. There's plenty of depth and richness to the full-bodied flavors, with exquisite balance and a finish that lingers.",92,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
56110,"Pale salmon in color, this wine is 63% Mourvèdre and 37% Grenache. Aromas of fresh strawberry, watermelon, spice and cherry lead to bone-dry mouthwatering fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal.",89,US,Washington,Rosé,19
80945,"A little gritty in texture, and the rawness is compounded by black pepper tartness. Yet there's a huge, succulent core of black cherry fruit, and the wine is perfectly dry and acidic. An interesting Pinot, one to stash in the cellar and see what happens.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,56
5501,"This fascinating Chardonnay combines elegance with the opulence you expect from California. It's ripe and forward in papaya, quince, mango, pear and pineapple fruits, but also shows a steely minerality that's as fresh and pure as snowmelt water in a pebbly stream. It is never forward or over-the-top.",93,US,California,Chardonnay,35
108888,"Kudos to Siduri for offering a serious Oregon Pinot Noir at alcohol levels (13%) reminiscent of Burgundy. It's a welcome tilt for the state that once was tagged as the new world's Burgundian hope, but which has sometimes seemed more like a California wannabe. Light and tart, this isn't a complex wine but brings the delicate nuances of the grape, with cranberry, citrus and strawberry.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,39
108104,"Hardly anybody gets fruit from the coveted Alban Vineyard, but Ehren Jordan does, and he's done a great job at crafting this dry, minerally wine. It shows Viognier's lush, exotic character in the fruit stand array of pineapples, peaches and mangoes, with white flower and mineral notes offset by wonderfully clean, crisp acidity. Superb.",93,US,California,Viognier,35
129592,"The aromas of herbs, pencil lead and blue and red fruit are forward, fresh and appealing. The flavors follow similarly, showing depth and balance uncommon for a wine this price.",90,US,Washington,Merlot,12
118510,"Sourced from seven different vineyards across the appellation, this ripe Pinot is savory in flavor, seasoning the dark cherry fruit at its center with spicy cardamom and cinnamon. On the palate comes a taste of thick oak and bacon with sizable tannins.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,38
124960,"Adelaida is assembling a good track record with this wine. It's from the cooler western portion of the appellation, so that crisp acidity provides a fine framework for the slightly sweet tropical fruit, wildflower and spice flavors. With its exotic personality, it's best paired with strongly flavored, complex dishes that combine poultry, game or shellfish with fruits, nuts and honey.",89,US,California,Viognier,30
120170,"A unique balance—9.8% alcohol and 2% residual sugar—with the subtle flavors of old vines a bonus. A gorgeous wine, tasted with escalar (white tuna) served as sushi. The buttery fish and the light, elegant Riesling are a stunning match. Neither overtakes the other.",93,US,Washington,Riesling,15
44224,"Given its high-octane aroma of barrel and petrol, this Pinot is defined by its need to settle down, more disheveled teenager than the groomed adult it surely will become. The bones are there, dark berry fruit and lurking, earthy spice. There's a developing softness to the texture, the aromas still being worked out.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
17374,"This wine—part of the “Seeds of Empowerment” fundraising series benefitting female do-gooders around the world—is light in the glass, crisp on the nose and laced with lime blossom, lemon peel, wet stone and Gala apple scents. Its shows bracing freshness on the palate through key lime, white peach and Asian pear flavors.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,30
130380,"INOX—from the French inoxidable—is Chehalem's stainless steel fermented and aged take on Chardonnay. It is consistently their best effort, with bright, acid-driven fruit that is a complex blend of pineapple, green apple, golden apple and Asian pear. It doesn't try to be more than it is, and it has a wonderfully persistent finish.",90,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,19
94672,"Pretty whiffs of tangerine and blossom are accented by savory notes of bramble and dust on this late-harvest wine. It's a quiet, light-footed wine but piercing shards of sweet-tart orange and pineapple brighten the midpalate. It finishes crisp and brisk.",86,US,New York,Riesling,32
108841,"Slightly herbal aromas and generous, almost chocolaty fruit flavors make for a mouth-filling wine. It is full bodied, moderately tannic, and nicely dry despite the bold fruit character.",87,US,California,Red Blend,25
13142,"Syrah makes up three-quarters of this wine with Grenache (20%) and Syrah accounting for the rest. It's fragrant with aromas of raspberry, cherry, herb and allspice that lead to plush, downright jammy fruit flavors that still show a deft touch.",88,US,Washington,Rhône-style Red Blend,25
11381,"This is an amazing Syrah. Few in the history of California have been this dramatically rich and ripe with flavors of blueberries, blackberries, chocolate, currants, cedar and baking spices. Yet the wine is thoroughly dry, and the alcohol feels balanced with a warm, soft mouthfeel. Delicious now and for the next 4–5 years.",93,US,California,Syrah,30
115914,"This is a barrel selection from the best sites at the estate (Jacob Hart) vineyard, planted in 1987. It's done in 3/4 stainless, 1/4 neutral oak, and comes out in a thoroughly delicious, well-balanced, fruit-driven wine. Pear, grapefruit, wet stone and citrus rind work together to create texture and mouthfeel, with a finish of fresh, lightly bitter pear skin.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,24
43294,"Blended from Verdelho, Viognier, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, it has tropical fruit, peach and apple flavors balanced with citrusy acidity.",84,US,California,White Blend,16
121908,"This is 100% Malbec from the Wahluke Slope AVA, and it is delicious. It has the sharp tannins and spicy herbaceousness of the grape, with very tight, tart cassis and black raspberry fruit. Firm, tight, pure and clean, it's an excellent example of the variety.",90,US,Washington,Malbec,38
55087,"This 100% Merlot was—intriguingly—aged for three months on Chardonnay lees. It has notes of herbs, cherries and green vegetables. It has an appealing, broad texture, finishing on a bitter note.",86,US,Idaho,Merlot,20
139270,"Purity is the word that comes to mind with this single-vineyard Cab. There's a translucence to the cherry and black currant fruit, and the way the complex tannins glide over the palate. The wine finishes dry. Drink now through 2010.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
103604,"A bit raw and scoury in the mouth, with some green, minty sharpness to the cherry, spice and smoky oak flavors. The palate wants to like this wine, but that sharpness keeps on intruding on the pleasure.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
84430,"This is Chimney Rock's best Stags Leap Cabernet since the 2005, and continues a string of successful vintages. Dry and smooth and silky in the mouth, it's pretty tannic, but very rich, offering waves of cherry, blackberry, blueberry, cocoa and sweet cedar flavors. Absolutely delicious, wonderfully elegant, and should age well for a decade.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,61
115951,"This intriguing mix of cedar and cassis, with meatier elements of black licorice, sings in the glass, remaining restrained and elegant despite a full-bodied ripeness and cradling of French oak. Priced below many wines of similar provenance and quality, it's age-worthy, too. Drink now through 2021.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
108391,"Light aromas of lemon, apple, pineapple, toast and spice lead to just off-dry flavors. It drinks a little sweet for a brut but still delivers enjoyment—a straightforward crowd pleaser.",87,US,Washington,Sparkling Blend,15
1363,"The cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer. It's certainly leaner, but for all that, it's dry, silky and elegantly complex in its own way, with dried raspberry, tea and white pepper flavors. It could surprise after 2017.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,56
31822,"This is bold in flavor, full in body and quite firm in texture. Aromas are densely fruity, like blackberry and cranberry, while flavors are ripe and deep. A strong mixture of tannin and grape acidity holds everything in rather tightly, especially on the finish. Approachable now, it will mature nicely through at least 2020.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,32
49668,"This is a dark-colored, dense wine, reeking of aromas fresh from the fermenting tank: juicy blackberry and plum and a strong herbal, earthy streak like mulch and mushrooms. It's well made and clean as a whistle, but currently the profile is austere, although some fruity depth on the finish bodes well for the long haul. Cellar for three years before trying.",87,US,California,Merlot,35
61199,"Smells inviting, with grass, gooseberry, pine cone, smoky and vanilla aromas, and drinks dry and clean, with citrus and fig flavors. There's a tiny hit of honey on the long, spicy finish. Really a nice sipper.",87,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,10
145253,"Sassy and saucy, with raisin, blueberry, pepper and earth aromas. Kent Rosenblum has crafted a wine that, within its class, is well above average, and we challenge you to find Zin this authentic for this price. What it lacks in nuance is made up for in girth and guts. It's chewy and rich, and it becomes more complex with each minute spent in the glass. Nothing weedy or green here, and the mouthfeel rocks.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,11
134545,"Harsh and hot, with chili pepper, mint and thinned-down blackberry and cherry flavors.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,12
138418,"This explodes with full-flavored fruit. A big boy, juicy and concentrated with ripe apple/citrus fruits, and well-integrated streaks of vanilla, hazelnut and butterscotch.",92,US,Washington,Chardonnay,20
62603,"Very ripe, almost like the berry-cherry filling from a pastry, this Zin also has notes of chocolate and sweet roasted coconut. It's rough and ready in the mouth, with jagged tannins, and needs meats and cheeses to balance it.",83,US,California,Zinfandel,26
42960,"More like the 2000 than the richer '97 or '99, J. Lohr's 2005 Hilltop Cab is very fruity, but a little too soft. The cherry, currant, chocolate, anise and spicy plum flavors have a melted quality. Drink soon.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
34680,"Cabernet Sauvignon (88%) takes the lead on this wine, with the balance Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Syrah. Aromas of blackberry, blue fruit, flowers and barrel spice are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors. Lightly chewy tannins provide some heft but have room to broaden.",92,US,Washington,Red Blend,75
112551,"Herbal peppercorn cradles a soft composition with an oaky, structured backbone to this wine comprised of 47% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc. Medium bodied, the cranberry, tobacco and plum play on the palate through a lengthy finish.",88,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90
46696,"It's hard to resist the charms of this delicious Syrah. It has brisk acids and tannins, yet it's curiously soft on the palate, with rich, exotically sweet flavors of black currants, dark chocolate, bacon and plum sauce.",90,US,California,Syrah,36
66252,"Very ripe and exotically delicious, with extravagant flavors of red cherry pie filling, raspberry caramel, vanilla custard and smoky oak flavors that are as rich as a pastry dessert. Fortunately, the wine is thoroughly dry. But it's hot in alcohol, and too soft to age, so drink now.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
96680,"This clean, simple and tasty sparkling wine is a Chardonnay/Pinot Noir cuvée, done in the traditional methode Champenoise. Pale straw in color, it brings flavors of green apple and pink grapefruit, with a clean finish.",87,US,Oregon,Sparkling Blend,30
59993,"A bit more rugged and rustic than Zaca Mesa's more expensive '07 Syrahs, and also somewhat less ripe. But it's a dry, rich and smoothly textured wine, good for drinking now.",86,US,California,Syrah,24
111273,"Tannic, heavy and a bit hot, and not offering much pleasure now, although it's properly dry, and there's a solid core of black cherry fruit. Finishes with a grapeskin bitterness.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,34
18073,"Packs plenty of punch into an inexpensive, everyday Chardonnay. With brisk, tangy acidity, it offers rich, appealing flavors of pineapples, green apples, vanilla and sweet, creamy butter.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,11
118307,"Tart in acidity, with simple cherry flavors that taste baked into a pie. But the finish is fully dry. Tannic, too, with the result that the mouthfeel is hard as nails.",83,US,California,Sangiovese,24
119011,"This light-footed Viognier has a touch of the blossomy perfume and waxiness expected in the grape variety. Unusually zesty, however, it lacks the characteristic oiliness and denseness of palate. It's delicate in concentration but an easy, breezy sip. Drink now through 2018.",85,US,New York,Viognier,40
112672,"This very limited, concrete-egg-fermented, and thoroughly splendid Pinot Gris is a good indication of the potential for PG in Oregon if the price limitations are lifted. Stunningly rich with citrus, lemon curd, ripe apple and light tropical fruits, this concentrated, deeply driven wine is both roundly full and amazingly dense. Certainly the best Oregon Pinot Gris in memory.",94,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,42
143496,"Everything's on steroids in this big, big Chard. For starters, the tropical fruit and spice flavors are enormously ripe and concentrated. So is the oak, which has been liberally applied so that the wine bursts with vanilla and buttered toast. Fortunately, there's good acidity to keep everything balanced.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,25
97251,"As this tastes pineapple-sweet, with a rich, creamy mouthfeel, it is for Chardonnay drinkers who prefer the popular style. The wine is best served chilled with similarly rich, creamy food.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,20
44427,"Impeccably dry with a brisk, sprightly character, this lime-inflected Riesling is elegant on the palate with a wet-stone minerality and hints of smoke and pressed apples on the finish.",86,US,New York,Riesling,13
28689,"Smoke and dark char notes permeate the nose and palate of this Long Island Cab, but a fairly concentrated core of black fruit hides within, marked by rustic notes of earth and moss. Lean in body with soft, finely knit tannins.",86,US,New York,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
72740,"Lots of blackberry, plum, currant and oak flavors in this classic Bordeaux blend. It's so ripe, it's almost sweet, except that the finish is thoroughly dry, with a stimulating scour of tannins and citrusy acids. Right now it's direct and not very complex, leading to the question of ageability. All indications are that it's not a wine you want to cellar, so drink up.",87,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,53
99801,"Here's a delicious Zinfandel to drink now. It's very rich in wild raspberry and cherry fruit, sweet tobacco, bacon and spice flavors, wrapped into thick but gentle tannins. Alcohol is high, but in balance.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,42
78112,"This opens with deep, dense dark-fruit goodness. It's a massive wine that bursts with blackberry, black cherry and cassis. After that opening explosion of ripe fruit, it seems to float through the mouth, like riding in a big-finned Cadillac from the 1950s. Consume this one within 2–5 years.",92,US,Washington,Syrah,40
80360,"Pretty raspberry fruit scents and flavors dominate, and in the mouth there is a sense of grainy sugars. It has good fruit and ripeness, but still seems a little disjointed. Perhaps more time in the bottle will help sort it out.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,55
125266,"Etude's Heirloom bottling is vintage-driven, and the 2005 is a great wine. It's a powerhouse that in its youth is full-bodied and almost heavy. It shows massive flavors of red currants, cherry pie filling, cola, figs and spices that taste like they were baked into a dessert pastry, except that the finish is thoroughly dry. What's hard to communicate is the wine's dazzling structure. Not meant to be opened now, it's a Pinot Noir to store through 2010, as it husbands its strength and gains bottle complexity.",96,US,California,Pinot Noir,90
121633,"Heavy, sweet and super-oaky, like a liquid infusion of buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and vanilla meringue. Will appeal to many, but purists will find it heavy-handed and manipulated.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,56
91621,"Made to benefit the exploratory organization, this high-toned stunner exudes flavors of Gravenstein apple followed by a slight richness of marzipan. Moderate acidity and weight makes it a fine companion for the table, finishing with a sense of welcome fullness.",92,US,California,Sparkling Blend,50
75846,"This bottling has been variable over the years, sometimes great, sometimes merely good. The challenging 2011 vintage has yielded something in the middle. The wine is nicely dry and silky in texture, yet it has real weight in the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors. Doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink now–2016.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
35294,"One of the producer's longest-standing vineyard sources, this Hyde is gorgeously savory and lightly textured, while offering plenty of depth and complexity on the palate. Aromatically, it presents inviting orange zest, cherry and cranberry, elements that follow in taste, finished off by a flash of white pepper. Fresh and fruity, this wine also provides smooth, yet sizable tannins.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,70
65328,"Mitch Cosentino used stainless steel fermentation to preserve the brilliant peach nectar fruit of this vin doux (sweet wine), then aged it in French oak to add a creamy mouthfeel. It's sweet and rich and delicious and shows another face of Viognier. —S.H.",88,US,California,Viognier,30
128135,"This is a lovely wine to drink over the next 3–4 years, from one of Napa's masterful winemakers. It has the hallmarks of Napa Cabernet, being dry and tannic, with subtle oak influences on the blackberry and currant flavors. Give it an hour or two in the decanter before serving.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
89106,"Deliciously rich and extracted in jammy raspberry, cherry and cola fruit, with lots of sweet oak adding vanilla and buttered toast. Could use greater depth, though, as it's a little one-dimensional. Drink now.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
112437,"Simple and rustic, with a soft texture framing cherry and raspberry LifeSaver  flavors.",82,US,California,Merlot,10
29289,"Dried apricot, citrus and brown sugar aromas provide allure. The flavors are sweet but never over the top, showing good balance except for the alcohol, which pokes through on the finish.",89,US,Idaho,Riesling,25
44705,"Juicy on the palate with ample black cherry and Damson plum flavors, this is an easy-drinking Pinot Noir with just the faintest whisper of tannins. Hints of bramble and wet earth add dimension.",85,US,New York,Pinot Noir,15
286,"While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future. Give it 6–8 years to evolve in the bottle for further complexity.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
59409,"This wine is hugely robust in concentration and power, a study in mountain-grown brambly berry and serious tannin. Bark, pencil and a wealth of spiced plum form the core of its character, with secondary elements of cherry and cigar box coming into play over time. Enjoy best beginning in 2024 through 2034.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,110
121736,"Rather lean in flavors, it shows a bit of herbal, savory aromas and tastes slightly earthy and vegetal like fennel or celery. But those aspects are subtle enough that it still makes a good sturdy white wine that is neither too rich nor too soft.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,12
77911,"With an earthiness that weighs down the cherry, cola and currant flavors, this Pinot tastes a bit heavy. It's properly dry, with good acidity and modest alcohol.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
40446,"Soft and tannic, with jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. Not showing much structure, and not going anywhere, so drink up.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,55
107754,"Brawny and fruity, this wine has a hot mouthfeel from high alcohol, accentuating the tannins. The blackberry and cherry flavors taste stewed. But the finish is dry.",83,US,California,Petite Sirah,23
7957,"While exuberantly floral, this wine feels weightless and breezy on the palate. It's a bit lacking in concentration, but tart grapefruit and pineapple flavors make it refreshing and quaffable.",86,US,New York,Grüner Veltliner,14
7698,"Dry and succulent, this brings tangy flavors of rhubarb and raspberry into focus. It's made for picnic foods—could anything be better with fried chicken? This is widely available and scores a bullseye if your target is a summer sipper.",89,US,Oregon,Rosé,14
97154,"This is almost two thirds Sauvignon Blanc, one third Chardonnay, and one percent Marsanne providing the ‘M' that completes the name. Fresh and fruity, pure and quaffable, this fragrant white wine is exactly what this state needs more of. Nothing wimpy about it, just great, lightly ripe flavors of citrus and stone fruits, without the crutch of oak.",88,US,Washington,White Blend,13
130238,"High in alcohol, excessively soft and sweet in sugar, this Zin leaves much to be desired.",80,US,California,Zinfandel,15
66854,"Gooseberry and lemon peel mix with a wet cement, stony character on the nose of this crisp sipper from the middle of Monterey County. It's light, bright and tart on the palate, with lime peel, grapefruit peel and grassy tones, all laid across a zesty energy and cement minerality.",89,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,25
32278,"This is a lovely example of the vineyard's strengths: It has ripe, mouth-filling flavors of cherry and cassis, which are set in an iron-like framework and accented by chalk and clay notes. It's balanced, and it will benefit from cellaring for up to a decade.",91,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,45
95853,"Pretty good for the price, a balanced, smooth Cab with polished blackberry, cherry, plum, cedar and rosemary flavors. Good value in a dry red table wine.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,9
31112,"This wine is 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Nebbiolo and 22% Sangiovese. The volatiles are amped up, bringing distraction from the aromas of cranberry, cherry and vanilla. The fruit flavors are broad and drink quite sweet.",85,US,Washington,Red Blend,25
125925,"Give this young Pinot 3–4 years to begin to develop, and possibly far longer before the fruit fades away. Right now, it's tannic and closed, despite sweet, ripe cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. It shows firm acidity and a fine jacket of oak that has not yet been integrated with the fruit. So intense and powerful, it's hard to believe the alcohol is a low 13.2% by volume.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,36
112651,"Fruity and lush, this Sauvignon offers a blast of lemon and lime, pineapple, apple sauce and cinnamon spice flavors, offset by crisp acids. With no oak, the fruit is the real star.",86,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,19
71577,"A medium-weight, silky-textured Cabernet Sauvignon, this is immediately approachable. Standard cassis fruit flavors take on a touch of leafyness or herb, while there's a touch of warmth to the finish. Drink now–2010.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,27
93883,"Dry, earthy and somewhat closed now, this shy wine isn't offering much beyond the tannins, oak and sour cherry candy fruit. Yet it's excellently structured, and seems to want a few years to knit together and mellow. Try 2010–2013.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
42315,"A soft, subdued Sierra Foothills Cab with the right amount of blackberry and chocolate throughout and what smells like a handful of coconut flakes for good measure.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
80303,"Smoke and dark chocolate notes abound on this elegant Long Island Merlot (made with 10% Petit Verdot). A touch austere on the palate, it has a black plum flavor shaded with hints of resin, leaves and game. Bold tannins add structure and power.",86,US,New York,Merlot,30
112848,"Some people are sensitive to the green, minty gooseberry aroma that strongly permeates this wine. If you can deal with that, the flavors veer toward slightly sweet pineapples, peaches, melons and vanilla.",82,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,17
563,"Plump black plums and concentrated hibiscus fruit meet with cola, sarsaparilla and tart dried orange rind on the nose of this bottling. The palate is more earth-driven, with crushed rocks, pine needle and mint flavors spicing up the tart plum skins and berries. The texture is excitingly grippy.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
35468,"The nose of this wine combines this grape's best attributes: bright, crisp citrus redolent in grapefruit and Key lime, but with a tropical touch of guava and pineapple. The palate is broad and ripe but restrained enough, with plush mango and guava laid against a chalky backbone.",90,US,California,Grenache Blanc,22
11034,"The tough, earthy taste of raw mushrooms makes this Pinot less than lush. That's despite some good Lifesaver candy raspberry flavors. The grapes are from the estate vineyard, in the Petaluma Gap. Cold vintage, cool growing area, slightly unripe wine.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,52
2526,"Smoky and meaty, this medium-bodied Cab from rocky Atlas Peak offers sensible acidity wrapped around spicy, dusty tannins and a savory aftertaste of tobacco.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
49350,"An appetizing hickory-smoke aroma and bold fruit flavors make this one stand out, yet it doesn't go too far with the woody character. A hint of bacon blends well with the ripe blackberry flavors, and the rich texture and firm tannins make it a great wine to pair with big portions of protein.",89,US,California,Petite Sirah,11
71800,"Grippy with tannin and firm structure, this warm-vintage wine shows rich red cherry, currant and spicy clove flavors. Tinged with a touch of reduction, it gains depth and mouthfeel from its prominent oak.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
98876,"This is a Rhône-style blend of Viognier, Roussanne and Marsanne. It's fruity in pineapple, peach, apple, mango and Meyer lemon flavors, with a honeysuckle richness, and finishes dry and crisp. A nice wine for drinking now with smoked meats, especially ham.",86,US,California,Rhône-style White Blend,18
55854,"A very fine Viognier, one of the best of the vintage, that takes the variety's exotic, sometimes over-the-top richness and controls it with crisp coastal acidity and a deft touch of minerals. Elegant and interesting, it displays utterly dry flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, fig, date, honeysuckle, vanilla, spice and flint flavors. Drink now for freshness.",93,US,California,Viognier,24
83222,"Lush aromas of ripe black cherries, graham crackers and menthol are generous and inviting on this promising Long Island Merlot. It's luscious and concentrated on the palate, but bracingly taut with acidity and a tart Morello-cherry finish.",88,US,New York,Merlot,49
92443,"Sweet and simple. Shows crisp acidity, but tastes like melted apricot and pineapple jelly.",81,US,California,Viognier,11
18542,"The 14 Hands Cabernet is more tightly wound than its companion Merlot, but the flavors follow the same winning formula, with a heavy emphasis on coffee cream and cherry tobacco. A generous streak of kahlua runs down the spine.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,12
80792,"Pale peach in color, this softly sparkling blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay smells sweetly of red apples and a hint of lanolin. There's a gentle sweetness upon entry that carries through the finish with a bright acidity and pleasant apple and pear notes.",86,US,New York,Sparkling Blend,33
44294,"Inviting in succulent, brambly berry, this is a balanced wine that takes a light approach to ripeness. Clove and vanilla add to its admirable length and breadth.",88,US,California,Merlot,32
8386,"Aromas of crushed raspberries, adorned with a whiff of chocolate and moist earth, invite you in. Young and tightly wound, this gradually opens into an elegant wine with a bright core of raspberry fruit. Threads of licorice, coffee, chocolate and iron add welcome texture and depth.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,48
13483,"Extremely fresh and fragrant aromas of black plums, baked alpine strawberries, vanilla and Mission figs prove rich and inviting on the nose. The ripe fruit flavors show on the palate as does an abundance of purple flowers, baked gingerbread and exotic brown spice, making for a tasty pour.",93,US,California,Mourvèdre,49
59693,"A new, high-end offering from this producer, this wine is made to celebrate and luxuriate in the appellation, which it does in its ying-yang of dark chocolate and cedar. Bright acidity uplifts a soft, creamy texture and firm, subtle tannin, allowing the blackberry bramble to speak.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,175
98097,"Tastes raw and overripe, with raisiny flavors. The raisin skin tannins accentuate the grape tannins, leading to a hard, astringently dry finish.",82,US,California,Pinot Noir,33
121503,"Given ample time in oak, this wine delivers size and strength, a feisty celebration of big blackberry fruit and muscular tannins, well representative of both the vineyard and the vintage. Strawberry, mushroom and truffle figure prominently, with a finish of black tea.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,56
118420,"The blend includes 5% Viognier, a nice touch from winemaker Joy Anderson, as it adds both spice and lift to the Chardonnay. Lime butter and caramel run through the veins of this supremely smooth and soft offering.",88,US,Washington,Chardonnay,10
141970,"This is a Cab-like Zin. It has a nice balance, lush but easy tannins, good acidity and instant credibility, but never loses Zin's woolly, wild, feral quality. Demands rich fare, like beef short ribs.",89,US,California,Zinfandel,30
70685,"This smells brooding like midnight. At this date, with the heavy usage of oak, there's plenty of espresso, licorice, pretzel and charred-wood aromatics. The palate feels seamless, with highly buffed tannins and silken acids. Lay this wine down for a few years for better oak integration—or if you're antsy, decant it for at least an hour.",90,US,Virginia,Syrah,100
106084,"A good, ruggedly tannic Merlot, with lots of sweet blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors. Tastes sweet in jammy fruit, with rustic tannins. Drink now.",84,US,California,Merlot,20
47570,"Although the 2011 vintage was difficult, Foris did particularly well with this lightly spicy, fruit-laden Pinot Gris. True varietal flavors of pear and apple are perfectly set against vivid acidity.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,14
13439,"This is at the sweetest edge of off dry (alcohol at 9%, residual sugar 5.1%) and it is loaded with citrus fruit—especially ripe orange—that keeps it lively and refreshing. A well-made, full-bodied Riesling that lingers gracefully through the finish, with a streak of lemon tea.",90,US,Oregon,Riesling,12
130678,"This has a lively presence in the mouth, with a generous dollop of cinnamon spice. The cranberry/raspberry fruit flavors are supported with tangy acids, and lead into a lingering finish that carries suggestions of metal and stone. Quite different from the 2005 Wyeast, this new release reflects a different vintage with equally fine character, a mark of true terroir.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,42
28683,"Ripe fruit flavors and a delicious spiciness combine to make this full-bodied but not very tannic wine easy to love. It smells like cherries and raspberries, tastes full but not sweet, and has a texture that spreads and softens on the palate like melting chocolate. It's made with 50% Zinfandel and almost equal parts Syrah, Carignane and Petite Sirah.",90,US,California,Red Blend,40
139870,"Heavily toasted, with buttery aromas of peach, lemon and pineapple. Very sweet on the palate, with honey, caramel, coconut and baked-apple flavors. What may be too sweet and sickly for some could trigger happiness for others. Not a unanimous choice among our panel.",86,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,28
16299,"A little sugar goes a long way. This dessert wine is primarily Ain, with a splash of Muscat and Viognier. It's quite sweet, with apricot, tangerine, peach, honey and dusty spice flavors. This would be a great wine if the flavors were more concentrated.",87,US,California,White Blend,35
7298,"From a lovely site in the Sebastopol Hills, this wine is tart and tangy with pomegranate and dark cherry flavors, deepened with spicy earth and cardamom accents. It offers length, breadth and a full-bodied expression of the grape and place.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,56
15778,"Quite a distinguished '99, with its flamboyant aromas of spicy blackcurrants and cassis, with an oaky overlay of smoke and vanilla. Feels good as soon as it hits the palate, with blackberry flavors that last through the finish. The jolt of dry tannins that makes the palate puckery suggests midterm aging.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,38
31164,"Immediately appealing, this draws you into the glass with dark plums and blackberries accented by barrel spices. It's medium bodied with a silky feel, plush fruit flavors, and a lingering, fruit-filled, almost irresistible open finish.",89,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
8041,"With brisk acidity, a bone-dry finish and some dusty tannins, this is an interesting Pinot Noir, with a silky texture and cherry jam, pomegranate and cranberry flavors that are ready to drink now.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,25
54149,"A beautiful, succulent young Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend that delivers plenty of flavor. It's front-loaded with blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate. Delicious now, but it's a little too soft for the cellar.",90,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,55
46710,"This is really one of the best values in Cabernet- on the market. It's so deliciously rich in blackberry, currant and chocolate, you'll want to drink the whole bottle right now. Kudos to winemaker Nick Goldschmidt for producing a wine this good at such a good price.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,21
119219,"So rich and complex, so decadently delicious, you want to drink the whole bottle. Takes the blackberries and black currants of Cabernet Sauvignon, merges them with Syrah's bacon and pepper, flirts with Grenache's cherries, and then uplifts it all with Viognier's citrusy brightness and acidity. A compelling wine that will hold through 2013.",95,US,California,Red Blend,75
110969,"This stainless steel-fermented wine opens with white flower scents and grassy, herbaceous notes, following up with tart lemon and melon on the palate.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,22
505,"Fruit from the Momtazi vineyard often has a strong herbal component, here matched to a tart cranberry base. This wine is young, tight, and slightly bitter in the finish, with a hint of pineapple in the acidity. Overall the winemaker's elegant hand lightens up the aggressive herbaceousness, but a bit more fruit would be welcome.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,44
64486,"A good, straightforward Chardonnay with ripe, tropical fruit and pear flavors. It's creamy and oaky, but brightened with crisp acidity.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,25
16299,"Swathes of fresh tarragon lend a green, herbal tone to cassis and black plum flavors in this pretty wine. Penetrating, grippy tannins are jolting on the finish, underlining a tight, brisk finish.",87,US,New York,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
100437,"A very pleasant wine for drinking now. It shows cherry, blueberry, blackberry and mocha flavors, wrapped into finely ground, soft tannins, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The blend is a Bordeaux-style, with some Syrah.",87,US,California,Red Blend,25
37674,"This tight, classic Russian River Valley Pinot Noir needs coaxing to bring out the lovely, lilting aromatics, splendid in savory dark fruit, cinnamon and tobacco. Restrained use of new oak brings a balance of richness and acidity, softened tannins and velvety texture that works in every way.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
129306,"A relatively soft entry, tart plum fruit, simple berry flavors and a hint of burnt toast. There is a slight burn also in the finish, that reflects the near-15% alcohol. A little chocolaty film wraps the tannins.",85,US,Washington,Barbera,26
149982,"It hits all the right Cabernet notes of blackberry, plum, cassis, tobacco, mint and even chocolate. Dry and well structured, with fine acidity and modulated tannins. So why not a higher score? Because everything is very light. Nonetheless, it's good value for the money.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,10
13382,"A healthy 8% Petit Verdot gives added strength and color to this wine, while the 5% Merlot adds smooth, layered, velvety-rich texture. Bittersweet chocolate and wild mushroom play off each other's sweet-savory tension, balancing at the end.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,70
145328,"Opens with pleasant aromas of cherry and raspberry purée, cola, Asian spice, vanilla and toasted marshmallow, then turns opulently fruity and dry in the mouth. It's not light-bodied, though; shows a weight of tannic density that suggests serious pairings, such as lamb and steak.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
71208,"With zesty acidity, this Pinot shows all the marks of a wine that wants two or three years in the cellar. Right now, it's delicately structured, dry and tart, with cranberry, sour cherry candy and ripe tomato flavors. A few years in the cellar will bring out a mushroomy earthiness that will make the wine extremely satisfying.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,34
66304,"Only 300 cases were made of this serious mountain wine. It's tough as nails now, filled with tannins and acids, and everything's shut down in the driest way. Deep down there is amazing fruit and authority. This 100% Cabernet will live for two decades, but if you must open it anytime soon, it needs serious decanting and the richest, most imperial foods.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
67676,"This is easily Hahn's best red Bordeaux-style wine. It's rich in ripe, attractive blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit, with complex, smooth tannins, and is dry. The main difference between it and, say, a Napa bottling is acidity, which this wine has plenty of.",87,US,California,Meritage,20
90589,"Very dry, a lean, austere Chardonnay currently marked by aloof flavors of lemons, limes and oak. Yet there's something going on. As the wine warms in the glass it becomes richer, showing hidden pineapple tart, macadamia and crème brûlée. Firm, minerally acidity is there throughout, making for a mouthwatering cleanliness. Drink this streamlined, Chablis-like wine now–2013.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,60
123698,"The blend includes 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Malbec, all estate-grown. The aromas are intense and seductive, layered with flower, berry and clove. Dense and youthful, the wine has compact black fruits, streaks of smoke and a strong flavor of clove. It's a big wine, with mass and depth. The new oak is pulled back relative to this winery's earlier vintages, to good effect, and the fruit can more than carry it. It changes rapidly in the glass, suggesting that once it's past its baby fat stage it will show still more complexity, while retaining an elegant precision.",91,US,Washington,Merlot,50
89061,"This lively, crisp and tantalizing wine emphasizes fresh green apple aromas, vivid citrus flavors of lemon and grapefruit, and a rather full body from energetic bubbles. An attractively tart mouthfeel turns creamier with each sip. It does just what a brut style is supposed to in terms of refreshment and lip-smacking flavors.",92,US,California,Champagne Blend,70
46718,"NxNW makes much less of its Walla Walla Cabernet than of its Columbia Valley bottling, though both wear the same price tag. This is the one to find—a deep, dark wine rife with smoke and espresso. Black cherry and cassis fruit—equally dark and quite thrilling—carries the center into a rich, ripe finish.",91,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
939,"Minerally on the start, this white progresses into oaky vanilla and brioche notes with a heightened viscosity midway through, before re-finding its vibrancy at the end. In between expect a full-bodied, fruity expression of the variety highlighted by plenty of ripe apple and apricot.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,25
4150,"This is quite a funky, gamey blend of 33% Grenache, 33% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 4% Alicante Bouschet, with beef carpaccio, concentrated plum and tobacco aromas. Dried beef, dried purple-flowers, asphalt, condensed black-pepper and deep balsamic-reduction flavors are laced through a charred palate.",89,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,54
41499,"This vineyard straddles the cool-hot line between Anderson Valley and Alexander Valley, but in this vintage, warm weather won out. The wine is good, but too full-bodied, and wants the delicacy Pinot Noir demands. The flavors have a heaviness more akin to Syrah. —S.H.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
98994,"Foxen's UU Block from the famed Bien Nacido Vinbeard fights it out every year with the estate Tinaquaic Chardonnay for top honors. In this cool vintage, the former wins out by a hair. Dry, steely and crisp in acidity, it shows vast tropical fruit, orange, vanilla, honey and buttered toast flavors that are delicious and refined. The richness and elegance strongly suggest pairing it with lobster.",93,US,California,Chardonnay,32
82067,"Roasted hazelnut with grilled pineapple and peach carry the aromas and palate of this vineyard-designate Chardonnay. Having spent 11 months in French oak (33% new), the wine shows barrel tones, however a bright acidity helps keep things alive and fresh.",88,US,Virginia,Chardonnay,30
21782,"Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer goes where his vinous muses take him and this new wine of his is a perfect example of his “why not” attitude. It contains 56% Nebbiolo from the Sumu Kaw Vineyard as well as 30% Syrah from the same, 9% Mourvèdre, 2.5% Viognier and 2.5% Roussanne. It's jam-packed in a lilting way with fresh, bright strawberry and intense aromas of perfume and freshly picked herbs.",93,US,California,Red Blend,22
62216,"A straightforward and pleasing wine, with red berry, cola and root flavors and aromas on a light-bodied, smooth frame.",84,US,New York,Pinot Noir,10
150847,"The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word “fruit.” It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.",85,US,California,Merlot,20
142290,"Smells rich and jammy--loaded with cassis and vanilla. In the mouth, there's more of the same, plus added notes of coffee and blackberry allied to a creamy, supple texture. Would rate even higher if not for the relatively short, tart finish.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,115
50536,"The Momtazi vineyard supplies these grapes. The wine has a sharp edge to it, a sense of raw wood that pushes against tart, stiff red fruits. Whiffs of smoke and salted chocolate add welcome nuances. The winery's AVA series provides interesting, nicely differentiated wines at somewhat moderate (for Oregon Pinot) prices.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
28312,"An easy Pinot that shows the variety's silky texture ripe, with sunny flavors of cherries and cola. It's ripe, and fine for drinking now.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,25
41550,"This is tastes a little soft and sweet, with raspberry jam, toast and white sugar flavors. Drink now.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
46195,"This is the winery's reserve, a lot and barrel selection. Nicely layered, it rolls through strawberry, raspberry, light chocolate and sandalwood, tosses in a hint of cola, and smooths out through a medium-long finish. Nothing is heavy-handed, though in this excellent vintage a bit more concentration would be welcome.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,55
8587,"Anchored in fig, plum and berry fruit, this is a substantial effort for both the vintage and the price. It will show best with hearty, cold-weather dishes. Hints of cinnamon and chocolate extend the finish.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,20
107261,"From 100% estate-grown fruit, this lemony wine is tart on the palate while also offering a strong taste of cinnamon, akin to Red Hots. That heat lingers atop a medium-bodied experience imprinted in toasted oak.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,45
119866,"This is a big, full-bodied Pinot, with Grenache-like flavors of cherries and Dr. Pepper cola. It's a little bitter now, and lacking in finesse, but could gain with a few years in the bottle.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
103354,"This opens with cherry cordial, cranberry, herb and barrel spice aromas that seem a bit off. The palate is marked by sweet cherry and cranberry flavors that trail off quickly on the finish.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
27197,"Some years ago, Willamette Valley Vineyards purchased the Tualatin Estate vineyards and winery founded by Bill Fuller in 1973. To mark the return of Mr. Fuller to winemaking, the new cuvée celebrates his 40th vintage. A tawny gold, it's scented with honeycomb and pineapple. Potent and focused, it carries those flavors into a finish rich with bee pollen and preserved lemon intensity.",91,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,35
127099,"Aromatic with streaks of truffle, cigar and black cherry, this lively six-grape blend is principally Red Mountain fruit, along with some from Red Willow. Substantial and mouth-filling wine, it's nuanced with rich flavors of cassis, tar, graphite and chalk. It spent 18 months in barrel, 73% new.",92,US,Washington,Red Blend,32
50826,"This Bordeaux blend features charred, barrel-driven aromas along with leather and black-fruit aromas. The palate is snappy and acidic, with plum and raspberry flavors poking through a heavy coating of concrete tannins. The finish is equally tight and grippy, and here the tannins are even more pronounced. Very tight and hard; time in the cellar could be the prescription.",85,US,Oregon,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,27
14422,"Fresh-squeezed yellow grapefruit and pear juice trend toward white flowers and a tropical style in this widely available, stylishly labeled and crowd-pleasing bottling from the pioneering Niven family. Apple juice and apple blossoms combine on the palate, where flavors lean slowly into banana and ripe pears.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,18
88723,"Spicy Syrah, with a clear herbal core, shows blackberry and blueberry fruit, along with lighter suggestions of compost, pepper and anise. Unfined and unfiltered, the wine remains proportionate and avoids over-the-top ripeness or heft. Best if cellared for another 5–8 years.",90,US,Washington,Red Blend,35
124167,"This young wine seems to be just coming out of bottle shock, and initially the flavors pull up short. It's showing strawberry and red plum with a bit of milk chocolate, sourced from Whistling Ridge, Durant and Bishop Creek vineyards. Just 10% saw new French oak. Give this elegant wine another year or so to smooth out, and drink 2017 through 2020.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,25
44352,"Deep, dark, oaky and tannic, this wine opens with powerful aromas of charred barrels and wood smoke. Juicy flavors of blackberry and black cherry follow, with plenty of fine-textured tannins and a lingering finish. It's made from an unusual blend of Petite Verdot and Tannat grapes.",90,US,California,Red Blend,16
133919,"A pretty nose suggests cherry candy, sandalwood and a whiff of maple syrup. Those pie cherry and baking spice aromas continue in the mouth, with a hint of truffle. Beautifully balanced and blended—nine vineyards contributed.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,35
86008,"Bold aromas of undergrowth, maduro, fruitcake and blackberry lead onto the full-bodied, assertive palate. This Bordeaux-style blend has a substantial amount of brawny tannins that crave to be paired with a hearty slab of grilled meat. The finish remains highly structured, ending on notes of espresso and dark fruit.",88,US,Colorado,Red Blend,38
14241,"Hints of savory herbs, lime skins and crushed stones balance the exuberant notes of jasmine and tropical fruit. Dry, yet delightfully fruity, it's elegantly structured with a lemon-pith astringency that lingers.",88,US,New York,Riesling,22
58068,"This delivers a bit of extra grip and weight compared to the widely-available Three Vineyard bottling. Pear and peach fruit flavors are lightly toasty, leading into a full-flavored midpalate and a medium-long finish.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,28
63061,"Lighter in color, this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend shows alluring notes of cherry, assorted herbs and bittersweet chocolate. It's elegant in style with a velvety feel to the fruit flavors.",91,US,Washington,Red Blend,19
65077,"This wine is reduced out of the gate but opens into kiwi, pineapple and herb aromas. It's light to medium bodied on the palate and needs more concentration and acidity to feel complete.",86,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,16
11760,"A smoky, charred oak aroma leads the nose of this full-bodied, high-octane and appropriately tannic wine, and vivid, peppery notes jazz up its solid fruit flavors.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,55
29364,"This rare varietal bottling has lightly volatile aromas of Dimetap, raspberries, woodspice and herbs. Cranberry, raspberry and rose-hip flavors are full bodied and show purity. Drink now.",87,US,Washington,Counoise,32
89514,"Tightly wound and a little muted, without much fruit on the nose or palate until the finish, which ends sweet. The Cab spent 26 months in barrel and is blended with 1% Petit Verdot.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,22
18336,"An unbalanced wine, with harsh tannins and some overripe, pruny flavors. Oddly enough, there also are underripe, green notes.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,32
122738,"This is a very pure, fresh and clean Chardonnay. While it's rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and smoky oak flavors, it's also well balanced. Shows brisk, citrusy acidity and a firm stream of minerals.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,32
39947,"Spicy and bright, with an almost-too-ripe note to the fruit. Sweet ripe berries are joined by hints of sweet tomato and fecund, autumnal flavors, suggesting that this Syrah should be consumed sooner rather than later.",89,US,Washington,Syrah,24
2856,"Quite light in the glass, the aromas on this bottling are also a bit weak, with cinnamon and red fruits emerging with patience. It's light and lithe on the palate, with candied cherry, rose petals and tons of cracked pepper making for a lengthy, grippy sip.",88,US,California,Grenache,38
35982,"Bright and vivacious black and red berries meet with dill, mint and white sage on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard, with a touch of sweet pine wood as well. Dried purple flowers are prominent on the sip, where touches of asphalt, charcoal and beef in a blackberry sauce are boosted by peppery spice.",91,US,California,Syrah,34
83322,"This is a very rich, fruity Sauvignon Blanc, offering waves of pineapple, guava, lime, green apple and honeysuckle flavors. Crisp acidity gives it a fine tartness. Nice for drinking now with spicy tapas appetizers.",87,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,19
56430,"From a dry-farmed patch of land inaccessible to irrigation, this bottling offers rounded blackberry pie, chocolate, sun-baked rock and burnt caramel aromas. It's quite rich and thick on the palate, with baked boysenberry and clove dust flavors, proving a touch sweet.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,64
111424,"Marked by sweet, jammy fruit and oak, this wine is quite good, but doesn't show much complexity. It's smooth and silky, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, raspberries and cherries, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. Could develop bottle complexity down the road, but it's a gamble.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,70
62761,"Fresh boysenberries and a blueberry sorbet character mix with notes of minty tarragon, dill and hot gravel on the nose of this wine, from an area between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Peppercorns are prominent on the relatively light palate, along with tobacco, espresso and boysenberry.",91,US,California,Syrah,36
51942,"Smooth with tannins, and ripe and opulent with blueberries, blackberries and chocolate, this is a gorgeous Cab to drink now, or in a few years. The Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend is increasingly fashionable and produces a complex wine in this case.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,55
100246,"This is a fleshy, fairly priced Cabernet from the 337 clone (hence the name), that has notes of dark cherry fruit and baking spice throughout, with just a trace of coconut on the finish.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
41101,"Sun-ripened bramble and dried herbs lend a savory rusticity to this spry yet decadently ripened Cabernet Franc. It's not a brawny wine, but powerful in impact, full of black fruit flavors and jolted by veins of fine tannin and pert acidity. It's lovely now, but structured enough to continue to improve till at least 2020.",92,US,New York,Cabernet Franc,32
60075,"One-dimensional and tannic, this Syrah has cherry and blackberry pulp and mocha flavors, with notes of anise, cinnamon and vanilla. It's like a Starbucks drink, but dry.",84,US,California,Syrah,28
41472,"Made off-dry, with a sugary edge to the citrus, apple and flower flavors. The acidity is tingly. Okay for an everyday sipper if you like your white wines sweet.",83,US,California,Riesling,11
59015,"This blend of 90% Syrah and 10% Grenache offers plum, blackberry and blueberry on the nose with sweet cedar, tobacco and vanilla spice touches. There is strong acidity through the sip, which delivers similar elements as the nose, with baked black-purple fruit and clove spice.",91,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,40
30462,"Soft, simple and a little overripe, with baked cherry and black currant flavors. Finishes dry and tannic.",83,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,11
129617,"A bit on the sugary sweet side, but otherwise this is a nice cocktail sipper. Shows good acidity coupled with pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and spice flavors. Would score much higher if it were drier.",85,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
91660,"The balanced character of the hybrid Vignoles is preserved in this pretty dessert wine from Wagner. A honeyed, floral nose leads into flavors of tropical fruit and a touch of lemon cream pie. Mouthcoating and lush.",84,US,New York,Vignoles,22
18165,"Give this tough, young Cabernet a good long decant before serving. At first, it's dominated by sharp acidity and mouth-numbing tannins. But after some airing, it offers black currant flavors. This is likely not an ager.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
27489,"Good price for a Napa Merlot this rich. It's a soft, fleshy wine, with silky tannins and red cherry pie, licorice, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. Drink now with beef.",87,US,California,Merlot,16
96950,"Underripe and slender, this wine's vegetal flavors appear alongside its blackberry note. Although it's dry and balanced, with firm Howell Mountain tannins, it implies richness but doesn't really deliver. The thinness allows the high alcohol to become prominent, making the wine feel hot.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,29
2835,"Dark-blue fruit, thyme, sweet barrel spices and mineral aromas lead to pitch-black fruit flavors that show the warmth of the vintage but retain their balance. The tannins provide some pucker.",89,US,Washington,Syrah,40
47579,"The 11th vintage of Abacela's Albariño is a racy wine, with excellent varietal character. Fruit flavors suggest a mix of cucumber, apple, citrus and melon. There's a trace of oyster shell minerality and a bracing whiff of sea breeze on the finish.",89,US,Oregon,Albariño,18
109169,"In the wine's youth, the aroma of new oak dominates, with that smoky, minty, spicy-char note. But in the mouth the fruit explodes in intensely ripe black currants and milk chocolate. The tannins are rich and softly complex. A complete Cabernet that is luscious now,  but has the balance to develop, if you can keep your hands off it.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,115
81633,"A big, rich, vital Cabernet with immediate attraction that is deceptive. Sure, you can enjoy it now, while it's brimming in cherry jam and red and black currants with a finish of rich, caramelized oak. But it will soften and mellow over the next eight years, and maybe even longer. This is Round Pond's best estate Cabernet in years.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
26084,"Pleasant cherry, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors mark this bone dry Pinot Noir. It's a little harsh in texture, with sharp acids and tannins defining a certain rustic style from California.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,24
67177,"This impressive wine dances in hearty clove and cinnamon sparked by a floral bouquet of rose. High-toned, structured and elegant, it has subtle power and concentration but remains fresh in the glass. Drink now through 2020.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
135596,"Shows the heat and glyceriney sweetness that often mark Mazzocco's high-alcohol Zinfandels. The flavors are of pie-filling raspberries, cherries, cocoa, cola and dusty spices. Drink now with lusty fare.",85,US,California,Zinfandel,32
138013,"Fresh and vibrant, showing berry-cherry cola, tea, clove, vanilla and smoky flavors that are just delicious. The wine is accented by youthful acidity. If you like your Pinots young, this is for you. However, it should knit together and improve with some cellaring. Best 2007–2010.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
70015,"The earthy and leafy aromas are akin to Chilean Merlot. The plum flavors are attractive but there's also an indistinct berry/tomato taste that lowers the bar. A smooth, round, carefree wine better geared to casual parties than contemplative sipping.",84,US,California,Merlot,10
59770,"This nonvintage blend is lightly herbal, with hints at pickle barrel and green olive under tart, lightly-ripened red fruit. Tannins are stiff but proportionate, and it's a good, every day steak wine.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,14
17876,"Simple and honey sweet, made in the popular style, with jammy apricot, nectarine and citrus flavors. Bright acidity provides clean balance.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,24
29108,"Medium-crisp, this wine delights in stone fruit and lime zest, with a taste of fuzzy apricot dominant on the palate. Showing a balance of body and weight, it wraps things up with a layer of acidity.",90,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,22
50525,"Nothing charming about this wine, which is sweet, acidic and fruity, like a Lifesaver pineapple and lemon candy. Pretty expensive for what you get.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,24
24563,"Extremely light on the nose, this bottling from a dry-farmed vineyard (that's four years deep in a drought!) offers delicate lemon peel and riverstone aromas. Light lemon curd and nectarine flavors play into a palate that's more focused on grippy texture, with some rain-on-slate minerality providing backbone.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,37
60889,"Hawk and Horse have managed to make a delicious Cabernet from a challenging vintage. Dark, earthy flavors of cedar, spice and blackberry, are enriched with plenty of smoothness and structure to give it that extra something special. Made by winemakers Dick Peterson and Scott Harvey from a certified-Biodynamic vineyard with rocky red soil at 2,200 feet above sea level.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
76312,"At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter. But in the mouth, the wine impresses—the fruit is pretty and round, the mouthfeel smooth. Spice and fruit come together nicely and chase away any austerity that may be lurking. The finish is good and layered.",84,US,New York,Chardonnay,15
75745,"Waxy citrus skins and fresh pineapple notes are dewy and fresh in this just slightly off-dry Riesling from Swedish Hill. While a bit lean in profile, brisk lemony acidity and a subtly fruited palate make it a refreshing accompaniment to even the most delicately flavored fare.",86,US,New York,Riesling,16
76800,"Sharp and peppery aromas of chive, dill and Key lime show on the intriguing nose of this wine. Good citrus energy marks the flavors, where ripe pear appears in the midpalate and a decent acidity carries into the finish.",87,US,California,Pinot Gris,17
124186,"A slightly reduced aroma unfurls from the glass, begging for more time to air before unfolding with structured layers of olive, sage and pomegranate. The acid-driven structure is noticeably lean and layered.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
64947,"Vine Ciff has become one of the most successful producers of Chardonnay in Napa Valley. The reason why, besides sourcing great grapes, is balance. Everything works in this wine, which is a mélange of rich tropical fruit, crisp acidity, a creamy texture, and sweet wood tannins.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,34
125542,"The aromas are light, with notes of cranberry, blueberry and wood spice. The palate brings plush but tart cranberry flavors that linger on the finish.",88,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,25
132976,"Tasted alongside the winemaker's 2006 from the same fruit, this shows both vintage variation and consistent terroir—the marks of a real professional. The complexity and vitality of the wine remain comparable to the riper 2006. Tart fruits, leaf, herb and streaks of earth make for a lively, interesting palate-pleaser.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
48849,"Barrel-fermented in half new, half neutral oak, this tasty wine offers crisp highlights of lemon and orange peel, along with substantial apple, kiwi and pear flavors. An appealing touch of crème brûlée comes out as it makes its graceful exit.",90,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,30
96191,"This is a real Walla Walla smorgasbord, mixing grapes from 7 Hills, Pepper Bridge, Va Piano, Loess and Yellow Jacket vineyards, representing three quite different types of soil in the Walla Walla Valley. It includes 6% Cab Franc, which shows immediately in the floral elements as well as providing an underlying minerality. Dense and tarry, with black fruits and a wonderful rock-based frame, this wine has excellent definition. From the scents of violet and blossom, to the sweet berry fruit, to the thick, smoky, chewy tannic finish, it shows heft and power.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,37
37582,"Organically grown and selected from a mix of specific vineyard blocks, Rex Hill's reserve is rather light in 2007, with tannins that are a bit out of proportion to the fruit. It's a carefully controlled effort, but thin and dilute, with strawberry/watermelon fruit and some tomato leaf creeping into the finish.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,42
36550,"Well-aged and drinking at a peak, this 100% Sangiovese is round and toasty, filled with plush cherry fruit, and just a smidgen of green olive. The barrel aging brings in accents of toasted walnuts through a full, inviting finish.",90,US,Washington,Sangiovese,29
42084,"Not quite ripe, with green, vegetal notes suggesting asparagus. This was a cool vintage, and the wine is from a cool area.",82,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
48722,"Rich and dense, this has blackberry and black cherry jam, mocha and spice flavors. It contains 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, which lends the wine weight and body. While it's technically dry, there's a sweetness that comes from the ripeness of fruit and the caramel flavor from the oak, which gives it a sugary, bacony taste. Delicious now and for a few years.",88,US,California,Merlot,40
35954,"This may be the quintessential site among the extensive Milbrandt vineyards that produce much of the K Vintners Syrah lineup. The Northridge bottling has amazing purity and concentration, with a beguiling mix of deep berry fruits and gravelly minerality. Supple power, muscular and dense.",94,US,Washington,Syrah,35
38454,"Dry, robust and gritty in tannins, this country-style wine also has a hefty dose of acidity. Its blackberry flavors are tinged with earthy notes of coffee and tobacco. Needs something rich and oily, like lasagna.",86,US,California,Barbera,26
43445,"Ripe, juicy berries dominate the nose, getting some aromatic lift from hints of eucalyptus and menthol. The mint and red fruit of cherries consume the straight-forward palate, which is more bright and lean than rich and tannic.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
131316,"With an elegance and minerality typical of Standing Stone wines, this Vidal Blanc sets a high standard for Finger Lakes dessert wines. Ripe but subtle aromas of apricot and honey lead to measured, lively layers of pineapple and nutty spice that are rich but balanced. The finish is long but also delicate, tingling on the palate.",88,US,New York,Vidal Blanc,25
112820,"At three years, this Chard is losing some freshness, and is picking up a dried peach and apricot flavor. It's also softening, which emphasizes the creaminess. It's best to pop the cork on this dry wine now.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,22
96097,"Though it was given twice as many new French oak barrels as the Estate bottling, this Vintage Select could be its twin. Solid and balanced, it mixes berry, herb and earth components, making for a well-structured, no-frills wine.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,40
107541,"Bramble and red fruits combine with spicy incense and oily coffee beans on the nose. Feeling viscous in the mouth, there are prominent flavors of coffee, clove, nutmeg and dried red plum. The tannins are bold, structured and well integrated, giving a crushed velvet feel. The finish is long with evolving flavors.",88,US,Virginia,Touriga,45
94898,"A cocktail of fresh strawberry, dried basil and thyme leads the aromas of this intriguing Cabernet Franc. While light in body and tannin, there's an attractive roundness to a palate of juicy red berries and pink peppercorns. Drink now.",87,US,Colorado,Cabernet Franc,30
8620,"This wine has a strong herbal component of bay laurel and eucalyptus, girded in fully realized tannin and a juicy underbelly of cherry cola.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
148505,"Slightly odd-scented nose with hints of pipe tobacco, grapefruit, green apple and herbs. Better on the palate with green pear, faint apple, pineapple and herbal notes in a tart, lean framework. Pleasant hints of oak show up on the finish.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,30
81606,"Simple and fruity, this has a mix of pineapple, citrus and apple, high-toned and slightly bitter. The toasty component from some sort of barrel/oak treatment is not yet integrated into the fruit. This will need decanting or aging in bottle until 2016.",86,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,18
118911,"This soft, country-style Zin has candied flavors of raspberries, red currants, licorice, pepper and bacon. It's sweet in the finish, with a sugary aftertaste. Drink now.",83,US,California,Zinfandel,20
31177,"Half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this Rocks District wine offers appealing aromas of tobacco, milk chocolate, herbs and plum. The flavors have an elegant styling but still have plenty of depth with firm tannins backing them up. It will be best after 2018.",90,US,Washington,Red Blend,29
37615,"At five years, the wine still retains some charm, but is showing its age. It's   a little tired in structure, and the fruit is fading, turning dry and leathery. But there's cherries and cassis, with some complexity in the finish. Drink now.",87,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,20
143107,"Lean, herbal and austerely dry, this Zin offers little in the way of fruit, although it's perfectly clean and decent. If you concentrate, you'll find modest cherry-berry flavors.",83,US,California,Zinfandel,14
92610,"A bit rough on the palate, this is dryish and rich, with flavors of citrus, sourdough bread and spice that are wrapped into the creamy texture.",86,US,California,Sparkling Blend,29
50529,"There are some interesting notes of earth and bramble in this everything- but-the-kitchen-sink blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc, Syrah and Sangiovese, but unfortunately they're dominated by notes of dried herbs and stalky green.",83,US,New York,Red Blend,26
56450,"One sip is all you need to know that this is classic Dry Creek Zin. It's full-bodied, softly tannic and subtly oaked, but the giveaway is the intensely briary, brambly wild berry and black pepper spice flavors. Drink this lusty wine over the next few years with short ribs or the greatest barbecue you can come up with.",89,US,California,Zinfandel,35
8705,"It shows the variety's dryness, acidity and light, silky texture, with lemon, lime and gooseberry flavors that finish tart and spice.",86,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,22
114900,"I wanted to like this wine more, but in the end, the sharpness, minty green herbaceousness and raw acidity mute the pleasure. It's clean, simple and inexpensive.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,7
50911,"Violets, smoke and fall foliage perfume this deeply concentrated Virginia Cab Franc. It's full bodied with sultry, black cherry flavors and there's a noticeable build in complexity on the midpalate amidst layers of crushed black pepper, charred wood and dark floral notes that linger to the finish.",88,US,Virginia,Cabernet Franc,32
80082,"This is a robust, full-bodied Zinfandel. It's so ripe that the blackberries have a raisiny, Porty note. High in alcohol and spicy, this is a wine that defines a particular style of warm-climate Sonoma Zin.",90,US,California,Zinfandel,45
31520,"A surprisingly ripe wine from this generally cool vineyard, it shows notes of toast, buttery spice, vanilla and tropical fruit. It's medium-plus bodied, creamy in feel with a tart finish.",89,US,Washington,Chardonnay,23
95299,"This is a big, voluptuous Pinot, solidly in the Garys' style, but it possesses a delicate silkiness despite the size. In its extreme youth, the wine is all primary fruit and oak, with flavors of cherries, black raspberries, red licorice, cola and smoky vanilla. It feels broad and obvious, in the way of a young wine. However, 1-3 years in the bottle should bring out complexity.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
103841,"Edmeades' longtime winemaker is Van Williamson, nicknamed “Vanimal,” and he makes big, bold reds. This may be his highest-alcohol ever. At 17%, it's dry and velvety, with fresh, fruity flavors of blackberries, cherries and vanilla-chocolate. There's no denying its deliciousness, but you'll have to decide if this heady, only-in-California wine suits you.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,30
117647,"Opens with a Provençal herb blast of thyme and lavender, then the blackberry tea and mocha aromas take over. It's a promising start to a wine that doesn't disappoint. Shows powerful fruit and spice flavors, with sweetly ripe tannins leading to a dry finish. This is a comparative bargain for a fine Napa Zin.",89,US,California,Zinfandel,18
128990,"Made in a popular style of crisply acidic, clean and slightly sweet flavor, with plenty of orange, pineapple, green apple and apricot fruit, this is a fine drink-me-now wine. It's good as a cocktail sipper, or with everything from Asian food to fried chicken.",85,US,California,Pinot Gris,16
126073,"A lovely Bordeaux-style wine, dry and richly tannic, showing complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, dried herbs and smoky oak, with hints of violets, cocoa and spices. Shows lots of elegant structure, at a good price. Drink now.",88,US,California,Meritage,18
12542,"A blend of grapes from Washington and Oregon, this includes 25% Semillon also. As you might suspect, it's an unusual wine, opening soft and spicy, with a lightly honeyed character. Fruit flavors emphasize lemon curd and key lime, and there's a refreshing ginger ale flavor running through the fruit core.",88,US,Washington-Oregon,Sauvignon Blanc,17
26727,"Young and oaky now, with toast, vanilla and woodspice aromas and flavors that tend to dominate the underlying cherry, cranberry and raspberry fruit. Feels fat and sweetly opulent, with smooth, fine tannins. Should develop gradually over the next decade.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,80
35738,"Beautifully fragrant of sweet black cherry and violet, this intensely fruity yet earthy wine is a standout within the Heart & Hands collection. Richly textured, it finishes with hints of spice, dried leaf and lingering, gentle tannins.",87,US,New York,Pinot Noir,30
46456,"Dense and tannic, with a lockdown astringency, but very finely structured and with great heart. Shows rich, complex blackberry, cherry and currant flavors. Finishes dry and refined, but will gain with time. Drink this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend now–2014.",90,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,50
122672,"A very rich Syrah, in the Pride style. If it's not particularly complex or subtle, it more than makes up for it with massive fruit and sheer muscle power. Floods the mouth with ultraripe, briary blackberries, cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha and plenty of black pepper and Indian spice.",90,US,California,Syrah,60
98561,"Dark and meaty, with aromatic hints of mustard seed, this has a slight bitterness around the edges, giving it focus and sharpness. A change in the barrel regimen now keeps it entirely in large format foudres. It's supple and lush, with mixed blue and black fruit, hints of citrus, and peppery umami notes.",94,US,Washington,Syrah,95
72020,"This new vintage is sourced from a single block from the Dineen vineyard, and aged in 50% new French oak—the most ever. Black fruits abound, along with licorice, tar and a whiff of iodine. It's a tightly wound Syrah, with the stuffing and style to age for a decade or longer.",92,US,Washington,Syrah,30
127228,"A gorgeous Shea bottling, this is lushly aromatic and fruited with strawberry jam, blueberry and cherry. The fruit is set against clean acids and supple tannins, and flavors remain full and focused with details of baking spices all through the long finish. This is a thoroughly delicious example of the power and pleasure of the 2014 vintage in the Willamette Valley.",94,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
110772,"The winery calls this a Super-Tuscan blend, a bit of a stretch with 33% Carmenère along with 57% Sangiovese and 5% each Syrah and Malbec. There is a strong streak of green bean that goes so far as to hint at asparagus and drying tannins through an earthy finish.",85,US,Oregon,Red Blend,36
30010,"An earthiness permeates this wine, from a wild site near the Pacific Ocean. Black tea, olive and crushed rock-influenced minerality keep it interesting as it goes, the tannins velvety though pronounced, especially on the finish.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,65
119945,"Iron Horse produced this Russian Cuvée sparkling to reflect one of their traditional styles with this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend. There are suggestions of honeyed strawberries and limes. Elegant and sophisticated, it's a fine bubbly for drinking now.",91,US,California,Sparkling Blend,40
79890,"Good price for a brisk, clean and elegant rosé sparkling wine. With a pretty copper color, it offers rich raspberry, strawberry and toast flavors. The finish is dry and honeyed at the same time.",87,US,California,Sparkling Blend,22
100417,"A very good, rich Cabernet, softly dry and tannic and stuffed with blackberry, black currant, olive, dark chocolate and cedar flavors. Feels lush and powerful, but not particularly impressive given the wine's reputation and price. Could be a sleeper. Cellar it and see where it goes.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,125
62462,"A well-behaved, rustic Cab, with pleasant blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. Very dry, with good varietal character, and a country-style personality.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,10
47872,"This is a real New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and tart, with rich gooseberry, lime, green apple, Asian pear, vanilla and white pepper flavors. A touch of oak brings a pleasant, buttery toastiness. The grapes come from the cool Arroyo Seco AVA and the warm San Lucas AVA, a brilliant blending decision that makes this wine especially balanced.",89,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,16
5320,"Marked by brisk, cutting acidity, this Chardonnay is bone dry, with a steely, stony cut of mineral that's relieved by lemon and lime flavors. It's a severe wine by itself, but it should be food friendly.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,38
121008,"A wonderful Pinot, whose dryness and relative austerity hides great power and complexity. Shows exquisite flavors of raspberries, strawberries, cherries and blackberries, with a floral note of violets and deeper suggestions of forest floor, beef and peppery spices. Wonderful now with decanting, and should develop through 2013.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
66846,"There's a reason K-J's V.R. wines sell like hotcakes, and this wine is a primo example. It's dry and very crisp and tart, just like a good SB should be. The lemon, lime, grapefruit, and peppery-fig flavors are savory and rich.",86,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,11
82001,"Anywhere but in Oregon, this could be labeled Pinot Noir, which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge. The Pinot is more earthy and tannic than in the Willamette Valley, and the Zin lighter than you find in California. The result is a wine tasting of wild cherries, tart, spicy and quite quaffable.",87,US,Oregon,Red Blend,24
72415,"Oak dominates this wine, giving it toast and vanilla caramel aromas and flavors. The underlying wine is soft and fruity, with blackberries and cherries. Drink now. Production was 24,146 cases.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
126082,"Too much of a good thing is how to characterize this Merlot. It's exceptionally ripe with cherries, red currants and mocha. It's also strong in oak. The result is a soft, syrupy confection.",84,US,California,Merlot,30
20536,"Thank goodness some wineries continue to be dedicated to Gewürz, and Firestone deserves special mention for producing this dry, elegant and affordable bottling. There's nothing like its spicy, exotic fruit and flower flavors.",89,US,California,Gewürztraminer,13
22944,"Almost jet black, this is a tough chewy wine with just enough blackberry fruit to punch through the tannins. Aging does not seem to have worked in its favor, so best to drink soon, aerate aggressively and pair it with a juicy burger.",86,US,Oregon,Petite Sirah,28
87453,"Fresh fruitiness makes this an appealing medium-bodied wine. It has aromas like cucumber and white pepper and flavors like a mixed fruit salad. The texture is on the soft, almost sweet side.",86,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
81517,"A savory whiff of nut accents fresh white grapefruit and apricot in this brisk, light-bodied wine. It's straightforward and quaffable, with a refreshing, citrusy finish.",87,US,New York,Pinot Blanc,22
74303,"This may be a little soft and simple, but overall it is a tasty Merlot that's rich in milk chocolate and cherry jam, with a touch of smoky oak. Drink it at a party.",85,US,California,Merlot,11
72306,"The Farm Winery takes a lighter, fresher approach to Paso Robles fruit, which works well in this bottling of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah. Bramble, dried strawberry, star anise and cola aromas lead to a round and easygoing palate, with cooked cranberry, rose, slate and licorice flavors.",92,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,60
14494,"One of the lusher, more delicious Cab Francs out there. It's enormous in baked cherry pie flavors, with the spicy, smoky crust, and a little heat from alcohol. Drink this generous wine while it's still fresh and young.",90,US,California,Cabernet Franc,36
122240,"Vanilla, cherry and a crunch of barbecue chips greet the entry of this full-bodied, weighty wine that's soft in tannin. Baked plum and cinnamon make it inviting and satisfying on the palate, finishing with a zest of racy acidity.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,44
59315,"The chilly vintage has yielded lean flavors of grapefruits and limes, but sur lie aging lends notes of cream, while oak brings a subtle touch of buttered toast. The result is elegant and complex.",89,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,40
51860,"Here's a lusty, fruity Zin to drink with barbecue and roasts. Rich in blackberries, cherries, blueberries, caramel, vanilla and spice flavors that finish glyceriney-sweet.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,18
49484,"Rich and jammy with concentrated, cooked blackberry flavors, this medium-bodied Colorado Merlot melds nicely with aromas of toasty, nutty oak. There's a raw, green pepper note that peeks through, but overall, it's a pleasant, accessible wine with a delicious roasted coffee finish.",86,US,Colorado,Merlot,16
149974,"Starts with nice cassis and black-currant aromas with a kiss of smoky oak. It's pretty rich for this price, with some real varietal character. Drinks dry and soft and fruity. This would make a very nice everyday wine or an inexpensive by-the-glass selection in a restaurant.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,7
99033,"Soft, dry and flashy, this has pie-filling flavors of blackberries and cherries, with some heat from the alcohol. The smoky spiciness and firm tannins suggest pairing it with steak.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
115579,"This is a New World, cult-style Cab whose high alcohol creates an impression of sweetness, but not of heat. It's succulent and delicious, a mouthful of black currants, cherry jam and milk chocolate that's balanced with lush tannins and acidity. Drink this decadent wine now.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,100
9184,"Joe Barton, who's made Grey Wolf wines since 1994, launched this brand inspired by pop songs in 2011. This Counting Crows ode delivers aromas of raspberry-laced black tea, clove and cardamom. It's soft and inviting on the palate, with anise, mocha and blackberry flavors that finish with a wash of tobacco. It was still quite tight after hours of being opened, perhaps due to the 35% whole cluster maceration. Drink 2017–2023.",92,US,California,Grenache,36
41974,"Smooth and soft, this is a restrained Grenache intense in cranberry and Rainier cherry, easy to drink and love. Made in small quantities from a Lodi producer known for its Zinfandels, it demonstrates the potential of Grenache from the right place in the right hands.",89,US,California,Grenache,32
109772,"Smashed black plums, mulberry and alpine strawberry show through the crushed rocks on the nose of this bottling that is lifted by a tarragon spice. Tangy blackberry and elderberry show on the palate, where wild thyme, oregano and peppercorns contribute to an intriguing sense of depth.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
117329,"This is a pleasant bottle, with pretty varietal scents of berry, flower and light spice. The tannins are light and rather soft, and winemaker Laurent Montalieu has kept the wine in perfect balance for its modest scale.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,32
55712,"There is a bit of sweetness which gives a quick impression of body to the light, cherry-flavored fruit. Once in the mouth the wine quickly fades, leaving just an astringent aftertaste with no particular varietal character.",81,US,Oregon,Grenache,23
49709,"This is a tough, gritty young Pinot Noir now in its infancy. It's made of acids and feral, forest berries, pine needles and spicy anise, a menagerie of mouth impressions without a clear focus. Yet it could meld together with some years in the cellar. Try after 2010.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,75
107859,"This is the Betz Family winery's Red Mountain Syrah. Supple, firm, compact, with black olive, mineral, red licorice, currant and pomegranate fruits. It adds bass notes of rock, iron and clay rather than the more earthy, composty flavors of the La Serenne, with a finish that's dusty, tannic, herbal, earthy and slightly metallic.",94,US,Washington,Syrah,55
95175,"Rather soft and candied, with fruity-sweet flavors of cherries, raspberries, chocolate and cedar. Drink now–2010 for freshness.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,95
96165,"This bone-dry blush has flavors of pepper, herb tea and baked cherry pie filling, and finishes very dry. It tastes a little tired, despite its young age.",83,US,California,Pinot Noir,20
22622,"This dark and brooding blend of 52% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 13% Petite Sirah, 7% Mourvèdre and 3% Tannat shows concentrated dark strawberry, meat char, white pepper and purple flowers on the nose. Those scents and varieties all come together in a savory show of roasting herbs and baked blackberry flavors on the plush palate.",89,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,20
64767,"This is essentially a mirror image of the 2004 Donedei Merlot. It brings the same dark, smoky, espresso-loaded scents and flavors, but it is sleeker, the acid more apparent (though actually a bit lower) and the tannins left to hang in the finish. This is a fine companion to the Merlot, but needs a juicy steak or rich sauce to cut the tannins.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
71396,"Here's a well-made wine that shows that this important producer can rise to the challenge when it retains its focus on varietal character. This authoritative, smoky wine smells like Syrah and it follows through with firm, supple, rich flavors. The floral and citrus notes, the herbal/olive underpinnings, the ripe—not roasted—fruit all hit the mark.",89,US,Washington,Syrah,32
56104,"An expansive, full-bodied and generously rich wine, this features present but integrated oak. Aromas of orange blossom and jasmine rise slowly out of the glass to lighten the experience, polished in bites of green apple and pineapple.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,55
113368,"This blend of Syrah and Grenache is soft and melted, with green peppercorn flavors along with riper cherries, chocolate and rhubarb. Ready to drink now.",85,US,California,Syrah-Grenache,28
64256,"There's a pure, sweet Cabernet in the bottle that wants to come out, but it's held back right now with sturdy tannins that make for a palate astringency. The flavors are explosive, of blackberries, cassis, cherries, chocolate and smoky new oak. Needs time. Best after 2011 and well beyond.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
11216,"Aromas are quite delicate for the variety and style, with fresh flowers, peach and whiffs of lychee. The palate is similarly restrained, showing elegance with the lightly sweet stone fruit flavors that are accented by bright acidity. It's all about nuance.",88,US,Washington,Riesling,28
140085,"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc comprise the blend. The wine is dry and very forward in fruit, with black cherry, raspberry, and smoky, oaky vanilla flavors. It's delicious and a little one-dimensional, so drink now.",87,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,46
111953,"Lush and fragrant, and happily and distinctively not tasting like a Washington Cabernet or Merlot, this is a bowl of rose petals and ripe cherries. Strong acids, earthy tannins, slivers of chocolate and a finish of espresso all combine into a lovely and lasting set of flavors. 100% varietal, aged in neutral barrels.",88,US,Washington,Sangiovese,28
55795,"A little more expensive than this producer's regular Chardonnay, it's worth it. Classic nutmeg and vanilla aromas lead to vivid and delicious flavors echoing baking spices, ripe apples and a touch of sweet cream. Quite full bodied, the wine's texture is also rich enough to encourage a lingering finish.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,14
79637,"Almost crystal-clear in the glass, this bottling shows broad aromas of red apple and peach before the grass, wet hay, squeezed lime and rainy sidewalk aromas stand up. There is a sharp texture and tension to the sip, where the warmth of poached pear is cut by mowed lawn and wet river stones.",91,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,24
86984,"A little gritty in texture, and the rawness is compounded by black pepper tartness. Yet there's a huge, succulent core of black cherry fruit, and the wine is perfectly dry and acidic. An interesting Pinot, one to stash in the cellar and see what happens.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,56
51153,"A combination of sweet, hot and puckering, it has a pronounced aroma akin to applesauce. At 16.5% alcohol it may be honest but it's also overdone.",82,US,California,Viognier,20
83211,"Merlot makes up 58% of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (33%) and Cabernet Franc. A blend of fruit from Anna Marie, Spring Valley, Loess, and Minnick Hills vineyards, the aromas are light, with notes of plum, raspberry, barrel toast and spice. The palate is soft and silky, gliding on the finish. It's all about delicacy.",91,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,50
50126,"A good, rich, somewhat rustic blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Syrah, made from the estate vineyard. It's bone dry and tannic, with blackberry tart, blueberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Drink this lusty wine now.",87,US,California,Red Blend,24
133868,"Here's a nice Merlot that's drinking well now. It has soft, fine tannins and a crisp spine of acidity, while the flavors run to ripe blackberries, coffee, cocoa and smoky leather.",86,US,California,Merlot,25
60564,"I like the underlying wine here. It's rich in cassis and mocha fruit, and has excellently firm tannins and balancing acidity. On the downside, I find the wine overoaked.",86,US,California,Syrah,32
36292,"The grilled portobello, roasted meat-bone taste to this wine suggests pairing it with beef stew and mushrooms. The wine also is rich in spicy wild blackberries, fresh-picked and ripe under the summer sun, but the finish is dry and firm in tannins.",90,US,California,Syrah,29
68207,"With just a handful of Merlot, this wine is dense and juicy, exhibiting warm layers of black currant and blackberry around old-school tobacco and tar. Medium bodied, the dusty tannins are well integrated and finely calibrated, giving the wine an age-worthy profile. Cellar through 2019.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,95
142406,"Totally dry, with harsh tannins that lock down the palate and last through an astringent finish, this is an unsatisfying wine that makes you wonder if it will age. It may do interesting things over the next five years, but it's a big roll of the dice.",84,US,California,Syrah,24
120408,"Layers of wild strawberry on the nose and palate make for an inviting entry into this wine that is medium in body and weight. Velvety smooth in texture, it's balanced on the palate, with a shock of earthy intrigue on the finish.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,42
130744,"Heavy, sweet and dull, with candied cherry and vanilla flavors.",80,US,California,Syrah,20
61807,"Stainless fermented, finished in neutral barrels. Talcott is a warm site, which produces a completely different expression of the grape from the winery's other Viognier. In fact, this is more like a ripe, rich Chardonnay, buttery and round, with toast and butterscotch flavors supporting the tight, citrus (lime, grapefruit) edge.",88,US,Washington,Viognier,20
49802,"A lovely plum shade, this blends scents and flavors of pomegranate, cherry cola, Asian spice, black licorice and a dash of cacao. It's dense and penetrating, yet drinking well already. It spent nine months in 40% new French oak.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,35
56195,"For an affordable, ready-to-drink bottling, this twist-top wine, which gets a touch of Sémillon, shows ripe nectarine, Pink Lady apple, lime water and grapefruit pith on the nose. The palate offers baking soda and lemon-lime flavors, along with tart apple skins and grassy notes.",90,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
122328,"With the interest in Moscato at all-time highs, this lovely wine should find a lot of admirers. A delicate orange-blossom scent rolls into flavors of pink grapefruit, lemon rind and rose petal. The acids keep the sugars in proportion and the finish refreshing.",89,US,Washington,Moscato,10
96642,"This heavy, oaky wine shows the pitfalls that Napa Valley Chardonnay can fall into. While it's very rich and sweet in tropical fruit and honey, it's soft and structureless, and tastes like it's already going downhill.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,70
111732,"There's a lot of good things going on in a glass of this Yamhill-Carlton sourced wine that shows notes of strawberry, mint, cherry and herbs. It's light and elegantly styled with a good sense of balance and a smoky, mint-filled finish.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,22
105525,"Syrah and Dry Creek Valley have long been good partners, and this dry, rich wine shows why. It's firm in tannins, but they're finely ground, giving the wine a nice grit to play against fine grilled beef or lamb. The flavors are textbook, suggesting black currants, black raspberries, violets, anisette and dark chocolate.",91,US,California,Syrah,24
74054,"This has aromas of prunes and burnt rubber, but it tastes better than that. It's a pretty raw effort.",80,US,California,Merlot,18
126766,"The wine is still showing a lot of rich new oak flavors: toast, coconut and vanilla crème. Sur lie aging (in 100% French oak) adds plenty of texture and the impression of minerality. Behind the oak is a lush mix of fruits, from tangerine and pineapple through papaya and ripe banana.",91,US,Washington,Chardonnay,36
47599,"This is the kind of Cabernet that California can accomplish with one hand tied behind its back. Softly tannic and smooth, it's incredibly rich and sweet in blackberry and cherry jam, milk chocolate and toasty oak flavors for drinking now at a good price.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,12
32261,"There's much to admire in this full-bodied, authoritative Sangiovese. It has the varietal's leafy tartness, with tangy red and purple fruits that are bound by zippy acids and tongue-tingling phenolics.",91,US,Washington,Sangiovese,25
121852,"Firm and dry, with tart acids and minerals, this Chardonnay's fruit veers toward golden apricots and herbs. Not showing much richness now. Drink up.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,24
93198,This Zin is rich with flavors of liqueur and spice with a suggestion of Dr. Pepper. Let this Zin open a bit in the glass. It's softly textured on the finish with a taste of raspberry and vanilla.,86,US,California,Zinfandel,20
9388,"This is a Westside Road site known for its rocky soils, and the wine presents sassafras, cherry-berry and roses on the entry before laying down a tightly woven mix of sour, salty cranberry and blood orange. It is softly voluptuous and velvety, though young, with a biting chewiness that should mellow in the cellar. Drink now through 2028.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,57
95881,"This elegant effort is 46% Cab Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 18% Cab Franc; still wrapped up tight and showing tart cassis and berry fruit. There is a lot of the classic Ciel minerality underlying the fruit, with hard tannins and lightly peppery herbal details. At just 14.1% alcohol, this is a classic example of how Washington brings bright New World fruit and terroir to a style that retains the elegance of the Old World.",91,US,Washington,Red Blend,40
73390,"This is a well-made, delicately floral style of Pinot Grigio, with notes of apple blossoms, crisp tree fruits and bracing minerals that add length and texture.",90,US,Washington,Pinot Grigio,14
145394,"Always an interesting Bordeaux blend to taste, this mixture of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Malvasia Bianca and Orange Muscat is alive with citrus, orange blossom, mineral and dried herb aromas and flavors. It's very complex in the mouth, and zesty with fresh acidity. Fun to drink, but also a serious white wine.",90,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,21
115738,"Shows that typical enormous Santa Lucia fruit that's so massive that it just stuns. Offers gobs of cherry marmalade, blueberry pie filling, pomegranate and cola-root beer flavors, yet the wine somehow stays silky-elegant. Who knows where it's going, but it's delicious now.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,43
126938,"Milk chocolate, blueberry and black currant combine around a soft core of subdued tannins and classical weavings of cedar and dried herb in this mountain-grown wine. It finishes in puckering leather.",87,US,California,Cabernet Franc,75
150683,"This wine, from a newly acquired property, is tart and young, grapy almost, with the fruit a little reduced. The wine seems to be in hiding. It falls off in the middle and finishes with tannin and little else. This may just need more time in bottle to blossom.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,26
79004,"Shows the rich fruit, acidity and silky texture of Calera's spot on Mount Harlan, with cherry, cola and sweet sandalwood flavors. It's not as complex or concentrated as the single-vineyard bottlings, but is a good approximation.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
79503,"With rich melon aromas, ripe apple flavors and a soothing, almost soft texture, this wants some rich, sophisticated cooking to go with it, like sautéed fish with a classic French sauce. Subtle acidity keeps the notes of almond and apple lingering on the finish.",91,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,14
119352,"Ultra-rich and decadent, Morgan's 08 Double L shows its signature tropical fruit, apricot and mineral flavors, accented with the smoky vanilla, buttered toast and caramel from toasted oak, and brightened with acidity. Although it's dry, it's oozing in glycerine and honey. Will not age, so drink up.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,36
36439,"Effervescent lemon, lime and grapefruit and a flinty edge define this crisp white, aged mostly in stainless steel. A ripe, unctuous finish gives the wine subtle power and voluptuousness.",88,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,21
101779,"The vineyard is source of high-quality fruit, but also intense mountain tannins that require time to melt. Under those tannins is dramatically rich black currant and carob fruit flavor, easily big enough to sustain 100% new French oak. By 2009 this 100% Cab should begin to soften and sweeten, and it will drink beautifully for at least six more years.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,108
16074,"This shows the sappy, sweet, ripe character of the grape; fresh and forward and bursting with flavors of just-picked berries. It's nicely dusted with chocolate and has both power and precision. The oak is layered in beautifully, enhancing but not obliterating the fruit. This is a wine to drink young.",89,US,Washington,Syrah,28
76372,"Not noticeably sweet, despite its low alcohol, this is a bowl full of crisp, green apple fruit. Clean and simple.",86,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,20
96247,"This is a high-acid, young Pinot. Bone dry and tart, it has green mint-infused, bitter cherry flavors, and the texture is nice and silky, even elegant. Yet it lacks the sensual opulence you want in a fine Pinot, and doesn't seem likely to age.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,27
40705,This has the richness of barrel fermented Sémillon (“French stainless steel”) without actually having any. Residual sugar just over 1%; gives it roundness and a hint of honey.,90,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,19
31218,"Made from 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Gris, this lovely Blanc de Blancs brims with vanilla cream, lime and pear aromas and flavors, with the yeasty, baked bread dough toastiness that mark the best sparkling wines. It's basically dry and quite high in acidity, which gives it a brisk, clean finish. Drink this fine bubbly now and for the next 6–8 years.",93,US,California,Sparkling Blend,30
116178,"There are lots of rich blackberry, cherry and currant flavors in this dry young wine. You'll also find the dried herb flavor that often characterize Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a bit high in alcohol and doesn't seem to be an ager, but it's finely crafted.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
89009,"With fruit from The Benches (71%) and Canoe Ridge vineyards, this wine offers aromas of toast, pineapple, peach and pear, with barrel notes (100% American) providing accents. Flavors are creamy in feel with a finish that lingers.",90,US,Washington,Chardonnay,20
137717,"Much as I love the winery's La Paulée, this tops it. There's more concentration and complex blueberry, mulberry, black cherry and plum flavors. It shows a whiff or two of mint, sage and chervil, and as with all Scott Paul wines it is impeccably balanced, non-interventionist and studiously clean.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
32780,"There's not a whole lot going on in this basic Pinot Noir, but it does get the idea across of silkiness, dryness, tartness and light-hearted cherry and pomegranate fruit flavors.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,12
39946,Strong mint and menthol aromatics give way to intense fresh-cut cedar flavors. There's just too much wood for this woodchuck to chuck.,82,US,New York,Merlot,18
54173,"Vast fruity richness in this softly appealing wine, with exuberant flavors of blackberry and blueberry pie filling and milk chocolate. It's fundamentally dry, but gives the impression of sweetness, partly from oak and partly from high alcohol. Drink now.",87,US,California,Syrah,25
29750,"This is a light-bodied, simple and straightforward wine with a generous helping of toasted oak, tropical fruit and sweet vanilla notes.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,26
8066,"Crisp citrus aromas and fresh lemon and grapefruit flavors define this medium-bodied, appetizing and unapologetic wine. With lots of personality, a tingly texture and tangy finish, it's just the thing for appetizers and first courses.",91,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,14
129233,"A 100%-organic Chardonnay, stainless steel fermented and poured into a handy-dandy, also certified-organic AstraPouch (1.5 liter). This easy-to-bring-on-a-picnic wine is clean, balanced and simply drinkable with a note of sweet grapefruit and pineapple.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,10
68943,"The nose on this bottling is a tad weak compared to other wines from the same estate, with a dense but shy black currant nose. The palate is wrapped in an extreme tannic structure, so it will need some more time to allow the pleasant black cherry, blueberry and charred-meat flavors to shine.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
87466,"A bit rough and gritty in tannins, this has a stickiness that pins the fruit to the tongue. But it has elaborate fruit, with ripe and showy blackberry and cassis flavors. It might gain an extra point or two over the next six years.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,76
79689,"Kind of Pinot Noir-like, with a silky texture, crisp acids and cherry and spice flavors. But it's rustic and simple, with a soft, gluey mouthfeel.",82,US,California,Pinot Noir,16
16202,"A rich, woody style of Pinot Blanc, the barrel toast wrapped around superripe tropical fruit flavors of banana, papaya and pineapple, with a hint of grapefruity acids. This is flat-out delicious, and could easily pass for an expensive Chardonnay.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Blanc,22
110085,"Lincourt's grapes are so rich and well grown that they don't even need oak to make a delicious Chardonnay. The wine is dry and crisp, with appealing flavors of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The savory creaminess seems to come from aging on the lees. What a great food wine.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,18
113645,"Tranche does an excellent job with this grape; here the palate-filling flavors are round and fleshy, with peach and pear fruit. Short-term neutral-barrel aging has further smoothed out the mouthfeel, and it finishes delightfully with just a hint of butter.",92,US,Washington,Pinot Gris,18
13319,"A more restrained style from Brian Loring, this conveys aromas of plump blackberry and plums surrounding a line of licorice. The palate is a bit thicker, with black cherry flavors lifted by bergamot-like citrus skins and chopped herbs.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
84195,"This is a limited (two barrels) bottling from a Dundee Hills vineyard. Tight red currant fruit is streaked with licorice and baking chocolate. There's plenty of acid, not entirely integrated into the fruit, and a hint of caramel in the finish. Good components, though not yet a complete and seamless wine.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
109045,"It's hard to find a Pinot at this price that shows real sophistication, but Stephen Vincent tries hard. The wine is racy and silky, with coastal elegance. Its cherry, licorice and cola flavors have a little kiss of oak.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,20
113517,"This bottling, from a vineyard planted in 1972, is still fresh despite being six-years-old, and represents a much lighter style of Cabernet Sauvignon that goes great with a chill. Aromas of strawberry, pepper, bay leaf, leather and black pepper lead into a tart and tangy palate, which shows a light hint of barnyard funk.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,41
22778,"Aromatic and complex, this wine, though not quite bone dry, is tart and citrusy. The mixed fruit flavors run a spectrum from grapefruit to lemon candy to nectarine, lingering gracefully into a mineral-soaked finish.",90,US,Washington,Riesling,15
129825,"Feels unnaturally acidic, with an ultra-tart tang to the ripe cherries, cola and smoky cedar. Drink now.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,38
90479,"Dry and softly tannic, this is a nice Cab to drink now with steaks and chops. It has herb-infused flavors of black currants and cherries, with a spicy edge.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
38521,"Lively aromas, an appetizing balance and just-rich-enough fruit flavors make a good combo in this medium- to full-bodied wine. It has subtle herb and kiwi aromas, crisp apple flavors, and a texture poised between supple and tangy.",89,US,California,Viognier,14
55872,"Included is a portion (10%) of Seven Hills Merlot; it's a wine that opens up immediately with pretty fruit and floral scents, some spicy highlights, and an intriguing darker streak. There's toasted grain character that comes from the vines, not the barrels, explains winemaker Rich Funk. The wine is supple and balanced, and the bright berry and cassis flavors are nicely counterpointed with streaks of toast, caramel and chocolate.",89,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
75902,"Using grapes sourced from Klipsun Vineyard, this is a roughly even Sauvignon Blanc–Sémillon blend. Flavors of sweet toast, lemon verbena and melon, with a hint of mint and a splash of orange soda are all in evidence. Nicely nuanced, this does not overreach, but rather zooms in on the details of aroma and flavor that keep it interesting.",88,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,25
74719,"The aromas of this fresh, tangy wine are like parsley, garlic and lemon, and the flavors add in tart grapefruit and green tea notes. Lively, assertive and refreshing, the wine will shake up cocktail hour or a seafood course.",90,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,24
84035,"Smooth and fruity, this all-stainless effort carries a citrusy tang into the finish. It quickly settles into a good flavor groove, with suggestions of fresh-baked bread.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,17
43226,"A blend of 54% Roussanne, 29% Marsanne and 17% Viognier from the sought-after vineyard site Alder Springs, this is an estate wine made in small quantities, gorgeous in apricot and white peach aromatics. Completed by a mouth-coating texture and crisp acidity on the finish, it offers balance and effusive minerality.",88,US,California,Rhône-style White Blend,39
63321,"A fruity-oaky and rather simple Pinot Noir. Offers plenty of upfront cherry-berry and cola fruit, with a kiss of oak, wrapped into a silky texture.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,32
88661,"This is bursting with peach, pear and almond aromas. It's balanced and light, with 1.2% residual sugar—just the right amount to pair it with spicy Thai curry or a strongly flavored cheese course.",88,US,California,Chenin Blanc,12
120882,"Restrained mulberry aromas interweave with scents of turned soil, white pepper and clove on the earthy nose of this bottling. The sip starts with a pleasing softness but quickly grows deeper and more weighty with luxurious tannins, showing hearty red cherry and dried fennel flavors.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
127882,"A heavy, softly ripe, super-extracted Cabernet. If you like sheer power, you'll get off on the massive blackberries, black currants, milk chocolate and caramelized oak.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
114295,This is a dry wine that's a bit acidic and watery with thin sour-cherry candy flavors and a hit of oak.,83,US,California,Pinot Noir,20
97621,"This exceptional vineyard, more than 35-years-old, brings a wealth of subtle details to a wine that has both grace and power. There's truffle, earth, mocha, plum, spice, coffee and on and on it goes, all well integrated already. Experience would suggest that wines from this vineyard, previously made for Sineann, are exceptionally ageworthy. Drink now if you must, or cellar and drink from 2022 to 2030.",94,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,65
125191,"Dark boysenberry, dried purple flowers, wet slate and a touch of bay leaf show on the nose of this thick and earthy bottling by the tech moguls T.J. and Valeta Rodgers. The mouthfeel is very chalky, and there is the winery's characteristic earthiness along with mocha and baking spice. But there are also brighter berry flavors, perhaps due to the sunnier slopes.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,62
125475,"This is a dry, crisp and very elegant Sauvignon Blanc. It shows savory flavors of lemons, limes and lemongrass, girded with a fine, structural minerality. Super-clean, it's a terrific partner to grilled shrimp, bruschetta with veggies and garlic, a ham sandwich, broiled chicken with rice, you name it.",89,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,16
146922,"A little prune, cherry and tobacco mix on the nose with some leafiness, creating a bouquet similar to Bordeaux. Black cherry and licorice are the predominant flavors, and in the end game there's a subdued coffee-tinged, reserved character to it.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
118842,"Feels soft and cloyingly sweet in pineapple jam and buttered popcorn flavors, and is beginning to be tired and old. Drink up.",82,US,California,Chardonnay,34
93310,"An eccentric wine, very high in alcohol, yet there's a strange vegetal element. Otherwise, it's all about sweet blackberry jam, mushu plum sauce, white pepper and charred bacon. The green veggie note, which winemaker Matthias Pippig describes as “savage”, persists into the finish.",86,US,California,Syrah,85
132623,"Here's a sturdy, somewhat country-style red wine with some superior qualities. Although it's a bit rough in texture, it has bright, jammy flavors of black raspberries and cherries, with hints of cola and cocoa.",87,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,49
147103,"Here is a full-blown 15% bruiser. Chewy, tannic and rugged, from vines almost 40 years old. Thick and chalky, the fruit has plenty of blackberry and black cherry flavor, with a smoky streak and a hint of black tea in the slightly bitter tannins. All that stuffing needs some additional bottle time to loosen it up and soften the rough edges.",88,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,21
45141,"Fairly light in body and accessible now, this has raspberry, cherry and new oak flavors. The flavors have a spicy, oaky edge, while the tannins are notable, and the acidity provides plenty of cut. Drink now–2018.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,58
125810,"Lava Cap has made a decent version of Barbera here, simple and blueberry-toned but the wine is a tad heavy and overly oaked and bitter on the finish.",85,US,California,Barbera,20
129580,"This is a spicy, earthy and medium-bodied selection, lengthy and concentrated in cardamom and forest pine. The fruit tends dark and brooding, with a brambly character balanced against the crispness of acidity. The spiciness persists through the finish.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
117242,"A flat, dull, tightly tannic Syrah that's meaty and ripe.",82,US,California,Syrah,40
31770,"The nose is full of baking spices, cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as blackberry and black currant, with a peppery note lingering under it all. The tannins are taut, with ample acidity lifting the spicy palate. Fruit notes of black plum and black currant meld with raw tobacco leaf. The tannins linger on the finish, with plenty of dark fruit and spice.",89,US,Colorado,Cabernet Franc,28
58484,"One hundred percent new French oak is the dominant theme here. It floods the mouth with the flavors of buttered toast and vanilla. The oak influence is strong, but the underlying wine has some equally strong pineapple, mango and apple fruit. It's made in a rich California style you either love or hate.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,44
140795,"Continues the tradition of ripe, intricate Firebreaks of recent years, although not quite in the same class as the '99, '00 or '01. Still, it shares the intense cherry and cassis fruit, smooth, complex tannins and delicious veneer of oak. Drink now.",91,US,California,Sangiovese,36
102911,"A little too hot and brawny in tannins, which provides a cut across the palate that interferes with pleasure. If you can get past that, the wine is nicely dry and rich in fruit, with cherry, tobacco, spice and oak flavors.",86,US,California,Cabernet Franc,35
49481,"This single-vineyard Merlot smells sweetly of ripe black plums with just a whisper of menthol and Band Aid. Soft on the palate, there's a good amount of dark fruit, but it's a tad tired and dusty. The finish is strong with a high-toned acidity and firm tannins.",86,US,New Mexico,Merlot,25
54708,"A good Zinfandel, dry and rich in the thick tannins you'd expect off Howell Mountain. The blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors are liberally spiced with pepper. Loses a few points for a certain green herbaceousness.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,50
17782,"This bottling has consistently been one of Eberle's specialties for quality and price for many years, and it still is. With residual sugar of 5.6%, it's sweet in honey, apricot, orange, guava and Meyer lemon flavors, brightened by crisp acidity.",87,US,California,Muscat Canelli,14
90964,"A beautiful Zinfandel, softly tannic and lush, and showing how Napa Valley dominates the variety when it comes to balance and elegance. The ultra-refined tannins frame flavors of berry jam, currants, mocha, licorice and pepper. This is really a superior Zinfandel.",93,US,California,Zinfandel,27
80008,"This is a briary, low-priced Zinfandel that has notes of smoky toast and clove, with dry, mountainous tannins. It's perfumed with aromas of raspberry and violet.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,13
48104,"Shows the thick tannins and blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and smoked meat flavors that make Petite Sirah so popular. But the main drawback is excessive softness, which limits the ability of this famously ageable variety to improve in the cellar. So drink now.",86,US,California,Petite Sirah,35
118727,"Here's a fun wine that will tickle your Zin tooth and then some. It's fantastically ripe and rich in blackberry, raspberry and cherry jam, sprinkled with anisette and drizzled with cocoa dust and vanilla extract. Although it's dry, the high alcohol creates a not unpleasant sensation of glyceriney sweetness. Ready now.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,24
21788,"A distinguished Cabernet, rich in fruit and impeccably oaked. But it's young. There's a fresh, jammy taste to the blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, and the tannins are brisk and fuzzy. Don't drink it until at least 2015, and it should develop for years afterward.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,95
18665,"Shows the full-bodied richness and fruity concentration of all Fogarty's Pinots. Brims with red and black cherries, red currants, cola, anise, pepper, butterscotch and sandalwood flavors that are strong, and framed in strong tannins. Needs 3–6 years in the cellar to knit together and gather balance.",92,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
4240,"A rich taste of caramel wraps around toasty charred oak in this young estate wine. Dense and chewy, it shows its youth and vintage signature, a sizable presence of tannin.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,100
116288,"Forward and accessible, this wine has broadly displayed flavors of berry and milk chocolate, along with more subtle details of cayenne and herb. The nuances sneak up on you, but make for a fascinating ride. Drink now or give it another 3–4 years.",90,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,42
26014,"Hints of bergamot add a musky elegance to tropical notes of sweet melon and tangerine in this beautifully perfumed Riesling. There's a sugariness on the midpalate, but the finish is clean and brisk, with a shower of pink grapefruit acidity.",86,US,New York,Riesling,15
42513,"This young Tempranillo shows light, pretty strawberry and tart cranberry fruit flavors. It's sharp and herbal, young and tight; a pleasant red that does not show any particularly strong varietal character.",85,US,Oregon,Tempranillo,30
127015,"Tart and jammy, with acidic, one-dimensional flavors of pineapples, vanilla and butterscotch.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,20
116436,"There will be far less House Red in the freeze-shortened 2010 vintage. As always, a forward, compelling wine, with a swirl of black fruit, smoke, earth and cola scents. The tannins are graceful and proportionate; the finish does a gentle fade.",87,US,Washington,Red Blend,12
33002,"With a translucent ruby color, this wine shows nice Pinot Noir character. It has a light, silky texture and flavors of sour cherry and raspberry candy, Dr. Pepper cola and sandalwood.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,13
70479,"This moderately aromatic wine offers notes of herbs, peach and soda water. It's medium sweet with lightly spritzy fruit flavors that have an herbal tinge.",84,US,Washington,Riesling,11
82155,"Made from Chardonnay, Albariño and Gewürztraminer, this is a clean white wine, brisk in acidity. It has slightly sweet flavors of tangerines, apricots, peaches and honey. A nice, versatile wine, especially with today's ethnic fare, ranging from Mexican to Vietnamese.",87,US,California,White Blend,12
36880,"A welcome addition to the Bunchgrass lineup, this white Bordeaux-style blend is one third barrel-fermented Semillon, two thirds tank-fermented Sauvignon Blanc. The ripe and textural fruit still shows a lightly yeasty character, along with highlights of honey graham cracker.",90,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style White Blend,24
57245,"Tangent is on the cutting edge of bone dry, crisply elegant and superbly fine white wines at everyday prices, and this bottling is among their best. It's wonderfully tart, with mouthwatering flavors of lemons and limes, Asian pears and minerals. A super value, and a sommelier alert.",90,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,13
50789,"Too sweet and soft for a dry table wine, but will appeal to those who like a sugary, jammy edge. The flavors are of jellied raspberries, blackberries, chocolate and pepper.",85,US,California,Syrah,27
107430,"This blended study of 2A, 115, 667 and Pommard clones shows black pepper, red cherry, pressed purple flowers, eucalyptus and a touch of hot asphalt on the nose. The lean and light palate conveys lots of dried herbs and raspberry-cranberry juice, enlivening the tongue with sourness.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
128150,"This is sweet and syrupy, with unintegrated grain and spice flavors. It seems way too young to be released, a mélange of grapy fruit, sugar and grain. The alcohol is an unbelievable 18.2%—good grief!",82,US,Washington,Zinfandel,24
100711,"Pure varietal, this was fermented in oak uprights and aged for two years in one-third new French and Hungarian oak. The oak accents complement tart flavors of raspberry and pomegranate. Give this another year or two of bottle age, and drink with pleasure from 2018 to 2025.",89,US,Oregon,Tempranillo,42
116310,"A common but drinkable Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with a rough mouthfeel framing cherry and herb flavors. From Testarossa.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,20
1002,A soft mouthfeel and fresh golden delicious apple flavors make this light-bodied wine easy on the palate. It has crisp and clean flavors all the way through.,85,US,California,Pinot Grigio,18
61767,"A bit too much cat pee for me, although the crisp dryness is appealing. Beyond that, you get ripe grapefruit, lemon peel and passion fruit flavors.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
9607,"The No Girls Grenache, from a vineyard adjacent to Armada (the source for the Cayuse God Only Knows Grenache) is lighter, more elegant, perhaps brighter than its companion wine, with fresh blueberry and other pie berry  fruits, a streak of umami, herbal tea and impressive minerality. Almost Burgundian in style, it possesses excellent length and wonderful texture.",93,US,Washington,Grenache,65
136875,"Shows the high alcohol potency and huge, briary power of this mountain appellation. Zinfandel's wild berry, cola and pepper flavors stand front and center, while the wine is notable for its long finish. Nothing shy here.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,24
14993,"Rich in apricot and orange marmalade, crème brûlée and vanilla flavors, this dessert sipper has a soft, honeyed richness. The residual sugar is 14.1%, making it fabulously sweet.",88,US,California,Gewürztraminer,20
39977,"There's a disagreeable sharpness and harshness to this Merlot. Despite some pleasant cherry, berry and oak flavors and a lush texture, that rough tartness persists through the finish.",84,US,California,Merlot,30
85238,"With 12.9% alcohol, this Riesling is absolutely dry and fascinatingly complex. High acidity frames citrus fruit, green apple and mineral flavors. Should develop in interesting ways over the next six years.",90,US,California,Riesling,27
146061,"An interesting Chard showing a bit of age. Picking up a nutty character, very rich and soft in the mouth, with nice oriental spice, butterscotch and ripe peach flavors. Finishes clean and vibrant.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,14
79043,"A big wine, ripe and explosive in fruit. Maybe too fruity, almost a bomb. Raspberries and cherries, sweetened with oak, dominate. Could use greater subtlety and restraint, not to mention grounding earthiness.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,26
49107,"Rich, ripe and round, this lush take on Roussanne is loaded with cantaloupe, sweet pineapple and Meyer lemon fruit flavors. The fruit is brought forward by a small amount of residual sugar, which seems like an enhancement in this instance. The finish has just a hint of honey cough drop—sweet and slightly minty.",90,US,Washington,Roussanne,25
123508,"Here is a friendly, fruity, medium-bodied wine with light apple and pear aromas. Off-dry flavors are more melony and floral, and the wine has a relatively soft texture. Made from old vines and fermented in stainless steel, it offers subtle charms.",86,US,California,Riesling,30
55164,"The Moscato-sipping crowd will like this wine. It's crisp and off-dry, with honey, tangerine and vanilla flavors, plus zesty acidity.",84,US,California,Riesling,11
66741,"Sharp and crisp in citrusy acidity, this Chard has jammy flavors of apricots, pineapples and vanilla oak. A little direct, but dry and creamy, and easy to drink.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,37
62992,"Fermented with native yeast, this estate wine from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir pioneer Josh Jensen is classy, earthy and firm. Apple and yellow plum flavors mingle with mineral elements on the palate. It finishes nutty and tart, with good length and a solid acid spine. One of the few California wines that are Burgundian in spirit, this is still tight. Although it was one of the oldest wines we tasted, it can still use a few years to fully unfold.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,38
16796,"Restrained and tannic, this Zin needs time to resolve and mellow its fine layers of blackberry and tar. Complex and structured, from 95-year-old vines, it should do that with aplomb, the wine more savory than sweet, a refreshing alternative to super-sized Zins.",89,US,California,Zinfandel,27
7455,"A layer of toast accompanies the principal aromas of white apricot and papaya. It feels slack and cushiony, with ripe tropical flavors.",83,US,Virginia,Viognier,18
88084,"Fruity, simple and lusty, this is made for barbecue. High alcohol gives sweet heat to the jammy cherry and currant flavors. It really wants to accompany charred meats slathered in sweet sauces.",85,US,California,Zinfandel,24
17254,"Medium weight, round and tangy, this shows a core of cranberry/cherry fruit, a whiff of cola and a suggestion of the tack room. It's a detailed and somewhat earthy Pinot Noir. From the estate vineyard, it's what you hope to find in Oregon— Pinot that is artisanal, a little quirky, distinctive and above all, enjoyable. Fades just a bit too quickly.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,35
99984,"This five-vineyard blend of Chard has superripe, possibly botrytised, flavors of apricots and new oak. It's almost late-harvest in style, although it's fully dry. A disappointment.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,32
25735,"Shows crisp acidity and sweet, jammy orange, pineapple and peach flavors that have a sugary finish. Defines the sweet, oaky, simple California style, if that's your thing.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,20
49811,"An intense, concentrated Pinot Noir, crisp in acidity and elegantly silky, with flashy flavors of cherries, raspberries, dusty spices and sandalwood. Drink this polished and appealing wine now.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,55
135423,"A very nice Cab, dry and tannic, and not too fruity. Shows subtle cherry and herb flavors that turn licoricey. With low alcohol, it's a stylish, elegant wine.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
8922,"Despite the challenging harvest, this Cabernet excels in juicy blueberry and plum tones. Dusted with cinnamon on the finish, it shows a level-headed use of oak, imparting a soft, expressive texture marked by acidity. Enjoy now or cellar through 2026.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
68832,"The grapes barely got ripe in this vineyard in chilly Marin, just north of the Golden Gate. The numbers tell the story. Acidity is .082 grams, alcohol is 11.8%, there's no oak, and the wine was stirred on the lees for five months. The result is an impressive Riesling, one of the driest on the market, a wine of great delicacy and subtlety. Fruit isn't the star here; minerals are. This is a wine to watch.",91,US,California,Riesling,22
56562,"This Merlot has a fair splash of both Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. It does not shy away from underbrush accents of leaf and herb, adding complexity to the cherry fruit.",88,US,Washington,Merlot,14
19568,"This is starting to develop some secondary fruit aromas, richly suggestive of fresh-baked strawberry tarts, with a hint of the Cayuse funk underscoring the complexity. Penetrating and dense, this is both powerful and elegant, with precision and pungency. The liquid minerality provides a firm foundation and elevates the texture. This is a unique style of Grenache, that ripens slowly into a lingering finish with dried herbs and tanned leather.",93,US,Oregon,Grenache,70
69136,"A good grip of acidity and tannins shape the fruity, earthy aromas and crisp raspberry and cranberry flavors. It's a very lively, refreshing style that is not overripe, and will be great with all kinds of food.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
122726,"This is a very dry, tannic wine whose mouthfeel is too tough and astringent to enjoy now. It has lovely flavors of blueberries, blackberries, sweetly old leather, cola and peppery spices. Feels like there's enough depth to last for 4–5 years and let the wine soften.",87,US,California,Syrah,35
12066,"This simple, soft wine has a ripe, chocolaty blackberry flavor. Not showing much structure, this is Malbec in name only.",82,US,California,Malbec,26
3923,"Leather saddle wafts from the glass atop ripe cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar. Tightly wound in tannin and oak, this wine becomes pleasantly juicy on the finish.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,30
79980,"Surprisingly, in the blind lineup, Ingleside's regular bottling of Merlot fared slightly better than its Reserve bottling of the same vintage. Overall, this is a supple wine, with flavors of chocolate-covered cherry and clove as well as a note of pear drop that cuts through the core.",83,US,Virginia,Merlot,18
84684,"Quite a nice Pinot Noir and in fact the winery's best in a number of years. It's marked by exquisite raspberry, cola, red licorice and sandalwood flavors. The most notable thing, however, is the acidity, which is rather strong.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
83498,"Loads of toasty vanilla from new oak sits on top of blackberry aromas in this dense, non-vintage red. The velvety palate lacks depth but leads to a long, cherry-flavored finish. Drink with grilled sausages.",86,US,New York,Red Blend,29
84980,"Tons of fresh, succulent cherry and raspberry fruit flavors in this savory wine, elaborated with sweet, smoky oak. Made in a drink-me-now style, it's soft and lush, with beautifully ripe, smooth tannins.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,95
46953,"In the past, the winery made a Mendocino appellation Chardonnay from a mix of Anderson Valley and Potter Valley fruit. But in 2010, all of the fruit is sourced from the Anderson Valley. This is fleshy, soft and lush, bearing grapefruit and fig flavors that are wrapped in a tightly focused package with a bright finish.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,17
59608,"This is quite consistent with the 2004 in terms of style, showing lots of vanilla-laced bourbon barrel, spice and buttered nuts in a tight, stylish frame. The alcohol is just over 14%; the wine is ripe, full, with a mix of citrus and green apple flavors, fresh, crisp and penetrating. It could age for another 5–6 years, as per a good village Burgundy.",90,US,Washington,Chardonnay,25
107758,"A little heavy and soft, with jelled raspberry, cola and vanilla flavors. The finish turns sugary.",83,US,California,Rosé,20
105250,"A juicy Touriga with nice structure and acidity, it bursts with notes of strawberry, cherry and vanilla spice, especially on the finish. A perfect pizza wine.",87,US,California,Touriga Nacional,24
25453,"This is a strong, spicy Zin, with a big, bold mouthfeel. It has lots of wild berry, beef teriyaki, cola and pepper flavors, while brisk acidity gives it a scour. It's also bone dry. The roughness suggests a little time in the cellar. Try after mid-2011.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,40
11196,"Remarkably inky in color for a Grenache-based blend, it features strong aromas of cedar, meat and deeply purple fruit. The soft, rich mouthfeel coats the palate like a luxurious lacquer, and features flavors of blackberry jam, macerated cherry and vanilla-spiced plums. The blend of florals, herbals, fruit and oak-driven tannins is masterful. Drink now by itself or with a peppercorn-crusted filet mignon.",95,US,California,Grenache Blend,65
118702,"Good and well-structured, but sweet, with cherry, blackberry, chocolate and anise flavors that taste like they were baked into a pastry.",84,US,California,Merlot,70
138236,"A taut, tense fight between the acids and sugars highlight this excellent dessert wine. A strong streak of spicy grain runs straight through the compact citrus and honey fruit flavors. The sweetness is neither cloying nor syrupy—rather, it neatly laces the wine together.",92,US,Washington,Riesling,20
96590,"With blackberry, tobacco and oak flavors, this is a sound Cabernet to drink with everyday fare. It's dry and smooth through the spicy finish.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
94241,"Peju's regular 2008 Cabernet Franc, released a year ago, was outstanding. This one's even better. It's arguably one of the best California Cabernet Francs ever. This is absolutely delicious in red cherry and blueberry jam, cherry liqueur, cola and sandalwood flavors. It's marked by an exquisite mouthfeel—all silk and satin. Give it a few hours in a decanter, and drink now with steak or lamb.",94,US,California,Cabernet Franc,115
30073,"Seemingly sweet and oaky, this has buttered popcorn, buttered toast and caramel cream flavors. The fruit suggests pineapples and pears.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,24
118880,"This Pinot is pure California in its ripe fruitiness. It's explosive in cherry and raspberry jam flavors, with sandalwood and dusty spice notes, and also displays crisp, cool-climate acidity. A delicious wine to drink now.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,38
124965,"Way too ripe and soft for balance, this Cab is almost Porty. It has simple, sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry pastries.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
103841,"High-toned aromas of cranberry, herb, black licorice and dried cherry are followed by tightly wound dark-fruit flavors backed by firm tannins. The finish extends into the distance. It's a highly structured wine, with its best days far in front of it. Best from 2021 through 2027.",93,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,125
18830,"Made in the modern style of lots of ripe tropical fruit, green apple and creamy oak flavors, this Chardonnay is uplifted by bright, citrusy acidity. Drink it now.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,19
88608,"Medium in weight, this offers a richness of plum and medium acidity surrounded by sizable tannin and oak. Cherry, dark currant and leather round out the characteristics, the wine aged in both French and American oak. The price is nice.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,18
62310,"Sourced largely from Red Mountain fruit, this includes 18% Merlot in the blend. It's toasty and ripe, with the barrel flavors most evident in both nose and palate. The Cabernet fruit is mild and lightly peppery, berry and cranberry mostly. There is plenty of chocolate, toast, coffee and smoke as well, presumably from aging 20 months in oak.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
131668,"At the age of nearly four years, this mountain Cab remains vigorous in tannins, suggesting 4–6 additional years of aging. If you drink it now, decant. It's a very good wine, rich in blackberries, black currants, herbs and cedar, with a very long, distinguished finish.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
52102,"Actually a little on the sweet side, this pleasant brut-style wine has rich flavors of limes, peaches, vanilla and spice, with a bracing scour of bubbles.",86,US,California,Sparkling Blend,12
23102,"An unusual blend of 59% Sauvignon Blanc and 41% Chardonnay, this wine opens with a creamy mousse and flavors of ripe apple. Crisp, soft and medium bodied, it's textured and good at hiding the larger amount of SB, resembling more closely a traditional blanc de blancs.",88,US,California,Sparkling Blend,20
41732,"A glass of pretty aromatics, grapefruit and orange blossom mostly, with a range of depth and texture that speaks of serious wine. Made from organic grapes.",88,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
123943,"Benton-Lane makes quite a lot of Pinot Gris, stainless-steel fermented and whole cluster pressed, yielding a soft, fragrant, fruity wine with plenty of fresh pear flavor. It flattens out broadly across the palate, full-bodied and lightly spicy. Just a bit more focus would really elevate this wine to the top ranks.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,17
144842,"Earthy and a little sweet, a common wine that's a little too rustic.",82,US,California,Chardonnay,10
135894,"This dry and brittle wine isn't offering much relief now to the tough tannins and minty, herbal flavors. It tastes like a blackberry lozange, with lots of acidity throughout. Ready now.",84,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,58
30092,"Just about every Dyer Cabernet requires aging. The 2009 bottling is tough with tannins, despite intense blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. The winemaker held it back from release even longer than the 2010, but it's still juvenile, with unintegrated oak, fruit and mineral notes. The window of drinkability is 2015–2025.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
124119,"Fans of simple, fruity Pinot Gris or Grigio should graduate to this fine wine, which is one of the best of class in this price range in California. The wine is bone dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity, offering a racy mouthful of tangerine and pear flavors that finish with a vanilla honey richness.",89,US,California,Pinot Gris,15
41900,"Just-cracked, yeasty sourdough bread and dried lemon-skin aromas float off of this bottle-aged sparkler from an esteemed, longtime producer. Her winemaker son named this wine in honor of her birth year. An oxidative warmth gives bready depth to the palate, which shows lots of toast and lemon marmalade flavors.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,50
102470,"This dull, rustic wine offers earth and anise flavors around a core of soft cherry fruit. Light bodied, its acidity is moderate and unobtrusive.",86,US,California,Barbera,28
76355,"Lamborn has a knack for Zinfandel grown on Howell Mountain. The 2011 is dry, tannic and high in alcohol, but also concentrated with flavors of currants, blackstrap molasses, licorice and cedar. It could benefit from some time in the bottle so hold until 2016.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,45
4740,"This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish.",90,US,Washington,Sangiovese,23
132255,"Fans of sugar will celebrate this sweet, rich red wine. It smacks of the essence of the most perfectly ripened blackberries, finished with a touch of caramelly-oak, then infused with melted chocolate truffle.",87,US,California,Petite Sirah,35
92486,"Unfiltered and broad shouldered, this is a fine expression of pure Merlot from the Walla Walla Valley. Though plenty ripe, the sweet fruit flavors have a pillowy elegance—the wine feels light but the flavors run deep.",90,US,Washington,Merlot,32
119429,"A wonderful Zinfandel, made from grapes grown on the estate vineyard. Shows all the briary, brambly, wild berry and spice character you could ask for, in a wine that's balanced and, in its own way, elegant despite high alcohol. Just floods the mouth with blackberry jam, blueberry tart, anise and freshly crushed black pepper flavors. Best now in its flamboyant youth.",94,US,California,Zinfandel,45
69762,"A glorious, tart and tangy Merlot, with vivid fruit that snaps the palate to attention. The acids are right upfront; if you like your fruit a bit on the sour side, as I do, this will ring your bell.",90,US,Washington,Merlot,28
144070,"Mountain grapes have yielded an intense, concentrated young Cabernet, grown on the Sonoma side of Mount St. Helena. The wine is brash, dry and astringently tannic now. But it possesses a classic elegance and refinement and a remarkable core of cassis fruit. How could it not develop, given the balance and harmony? Best 2008–2015.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,80
53458,"Good varietal flavors of citrus fruits, wildflowers, gooseberries and vanilla in this wine, along with crisp acidity. On the downside is too much sugary sweetness, which makes it cloying.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
25737,"Simple and sweet, showing cherry pie filling and cola flavors. The mouthfeel is soft, lacking vitality. An okay Pinot, but nothing special.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,20
125194,"This is a remarkable effort at the price, the wine sourced from Beckstoffer-owned sites in Carneros. Apple, peach and lemon highlight an integrated, vibrantly fresh experience on the palate, which lingers and impresses long after the finish.",93,US,California,Chardonnay,20
9135,"Despite the excellent vintage, this seems more tannic than ripe. The fruit is simple and leafy, with tea flavors and a chalky finish.",86,US,Oregon,Merlot,35
3022,"“Rhône times three” seems to be the code name for this classy blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. It takes the best from each grape, creating a rich, pure, high-acid wine with a zingy berry flavor, plus a mineral underpinning and earthy, coffee-soaked tannins.",92,US,Washington,Rhône-style Red Blend,30
113410,"Offers a good modern interpretation of Chardonnay, with its ripe, oaky flavors and creamy texture. Grilled pineapples, mashed green pears, buttered toast, caramel and vanilla, brightened with crisp acidity.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,30
30309,"In this straightforward quaffer, aromas of pear, melon and apple lead to off-dry fruit flavors with a full feel. The flavor concentration is light but it still provides easy drinking enjoyment.",85,US,Washington,Pinot Gris,16
62830,"Nottingham Cellars' blend of Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Syrah, all from the 2009, 2010 and 2011 vintages, is an interesting experiment in blending and makes for a fine, earthy, brooding wine. With so much chewy cranberry-dominated flavor, this is a good food wine, especially for early spring fare.",87,US,California,Red Blend,24
85018,"Warm whiffs of cinnamon and brioche accent aromas of black cherry and plum on this plush, fruit-forward Saperavi. Plummy and soft with black-fruit flavor, it's a straightforward, yet tasty wine. Finishes with a fringe of fine, delicate tannins.",86,US,New York,Saperavi,30
57172,"A lighter style of Zin, perfect for grilled meats and poultry. The wine is bone dry, with gentle tannins framing flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola, cocoa, cracked black pepper and Asian spicebox.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,18
45443,"Shows class and elegance in the dryness, astringent tannins and crisp acidity that frame the blackberry, blueberry, teriyaki beef and spice flavors. The astringency is an integral part of the wine's structure. Drink this over the next six years with rich lamb, game and beef dishes.",91,US,California,Syrah,16
89819,"It's a rustic, slightly raisiny Bordeaux blend (with a little Syrah also), sourced from excellent vineyards, but a bit overripe. Soft, forward and a little leathery, it's ready to drink up.",85,US,Washington,Red Blend,16
12955,"X is for extra dry, and this is, made from 74% Pinot Noir, the remainder Chardonnay. It jumps out of the glass in an explosion of nutty, salty lemon peel, dry as a bone and rewarding in its full embrace of minerality. This sparkler begs for oysters and a skiff out to sea.",94,US,California,Sparkling Blend,50
142699,"Defines Tchelistcheff's iron-fist-in-a-velvet-glove description of Stags Leap District Cabernets. Seductively soft, a wine that caresses the palate with gentle tannins and sweet, creamy oak, framing ripe blackcurrant fruit and rich spice. The power is in the focus, brilliance and overall purity.",95,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
73284,"The hot climate in which the grapes were grown shows in this wine's extreme softness and jammy ripeness. It's almost sweet, like a cherry and raspberry pastry.",84,US,California,Grenache,18
42916,"This is a reserve-style wine crafted from lots sourced from some of the winery's Napa mountain properties. It's not showing all that well now, due to hard, jagged tannins. Yet there are promising signs. The oak already is marrying the fruit, resulting in a seamless, smoky sweetness, and the tannins are entirely ripe. Should develop well over the next 6–8 years, possibly longer.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
45018,"A very pretty, polished Pinot Noir, sourced from the cooler, foggier southern part of the valley, near River Road. Shows considerable acidity that stings the palate, but the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, enhanced with sweet oak, are very rich. Now–2013.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
129020,"An elegant balance of earth and fruit, this ripe, full-bodied Malbec offers luscious black-cherry flavor against a savory backdrop of bramble, mushroom and mineral. Dusty cocoa and blackberry-jam flavors are penetrating but comforting. Fine persistent tannins and a subtle singe of heat mark the finish.",88,US,New York,Malbec,34
49935,"Herbal and short, this offers a very light watermelon flavor, along with plenty of herb and tomato leaf notes. It's on the slender side, with a quick-to-fade finish.",85,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
128753,"Off-dry, with sugary flavors of dusty spices, pineapples, honeysuckle, apricots and peaches. Not terribly complicated, but savory and crisply clean.",85,US,California,Gewürztraminer,16
6163,"Succulent and opulent, with ripe pineapple purée, Meyer lemon tart, kiwi fruit, pastry crust and tangy mineral flavors, enriched with the buttered toast and caramel of new oak.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,29
133260,"There's no oak to give fans their daily dose of buttered toast and vanilla. But there is plenty of pure, unadulterated fruit—apricots and peaches to be exact. It's a rich, spicy wine that advances the argument for no-oak Chard.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,18
11860,"This wine's aromas are perfectly pretty but with a sharp edge, blending tight boysenberry, raspberry and red-apple with lilac and scarlet-red rose-petal florality and an anise-peppercorn spice. The palate is full, soft and yet focused, with dried strawberry, plum and red cherries giving way to pencil lead and sage.",95,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
96496,"This Merlot-centric wine brings aromas of herbs, soy and dried raisins, seeminlyg a bit past it prime. The flavors are lightly and the tannins seem dried out. Drink now.",85,US,Washington,Merlot,40
19228,"The name suggests the Aussie Shiraz style of this richly fruity Syrah. It offers a mouthburst of juicy raspberries, blackberries, cherries, cocoa, bacon, licorice and sandalwood, wrapped into firm tannins. Drink now, with rich fare, like BBQ or a holiday smoked ham.",86,US,California,Syrah,28
92401,"Very dry and tannic, this Malbec has an unrelieved toughness in the mouth, despite some good cherry flavors. The texture is just too hard, and shows some bitterness in the finish. Drink now.",85,US,California,Malbec,32
27366,"Overripe notes of raisins and prunes detract from this wine's enjoyment. Its tannins are augmented by a hint of bitterness and it's a bit hot on the finish, but a juicy cheeseburger will resolve any of these problems.",84,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,49
11526,"This is a crisp and bracing wine, that pops with bright citrus and wet stone flavors. It's fully ripe, but leans toward greener flavors, with accents of cucumber and celery. The freshness and outstanding palate presence suggest drinking this wine within a couple of years of release.",90,US,Oregon,Sauvignon Blanc,18
97957,"This is an interesting and different wine. It's much lower in alcohol than most Cabs, but completely dry, with a tobacco and sage pull to the black currant flavors. The firm tannins suggest cellar possibilities.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
20041,"This Tempranillo is firm, tight, acidic and compact, a difficult wine to assess. It's got the Cayuse funk, with sharper acidity and a wet stone foundation. The fruit is very tart and tight, with a base of cement and some spice and herb.",91,US,Oregon,Tempranillo,70
75438,"Shows the rich flamboyance you expect in a Viognier, with enormously ripe tropical fruit, apricot, wildflower, vanilla and spice flavors. Easy to drink as a cocktail wine with hors d'oeuvres, like tempura dipped into soy sauce.",85,US,California,Viognier,33
59057,"This is a very rich, fruity Pinot Noir, so if you like ripeness, you'll love it. Floods the mouth with cherries, raspberries and strawberries, while 50% new French oak adds even richer notes of vanilla and buttered toast. It's flamboyant now, and should be opened in the next 3–4 years.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
55368,"This was aged in used French barrels for several months, just enough to give it a rich edge of soft butter and honey. The basic fruit flavors are pure, ripe and delicious, with suggesting notes of tangerine and mango, brightened by a vibrant thread of lime juice.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,36
131087,"All estate-grown and barrel fermented, this ripe and delicious white wine opens with scents of sweet hay, then is quickly wrapped in flavors of lemon zest, grapefruit and candied citrus. There's a dusty note as well, and the richness keeps bringing in more nuances—of English Breakfast tea, sweet stone fruits and lightly tropical papaya. Supple, round and luscious, it has excellent length and a clean exit.",93,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,18
14034,"This bottling is leveled by 10% Roussanne, and shows ripe yellow peach, honeydew melon, honeyed toast, pear custard and a slight cashew-like marzipan on the fairly dense nose. Rounded flavors of pear, melon, mango and honey dust comprise the palate.",88,US,California,Viognier,35
28143,"Much of the fruit for this wine came from Alexander Valley and it represents the appellation well, combining the ability to be juicy and approachable with powerful tannins and the potential to age. Cassis, raspberry and black pepper are standout characteristics, and the wine is big, but balanced.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
4121,"This is a big, tough, tight and somewhat puzzling Pinot Noir. It's bone dry, moderate in alcohol and tart in acidity, with sour red cherry, cranberry, Dr. Pepper cola and new French oak flavors. It's hard and rude right now, although its inherent elegance shines through. The question is ageability. Give it until 2018 and see what it's doing.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,44
124089,"Each year this value red blend is surprisingly different. With Syrah as the main component, it's spicier, more sappy and loaded with bright and forward berry flavors. The Bordeaux grapes that fill in the second half of the blend add notes of herb, earth, leaf and a hint of stone. It's a delicious, fine value.",88,US,Washington,Red Blend,15
37626,"There is plenty of green tea flavor running through the fruit and the tannins here, along with dark cherry and bitter chocolate. A rustic, rough, but perfectly enjoyable take on pure Cab Franc.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Franc,12
45016,"A beautiful Chardonnay at a great price compared to what's out there. Shows brilliantly ripe pineapple, pear and guava flavors, with crisp Central Coast acidity and a bracing minerality. Nice to drink by itself, with shellfish or even with a citrus fruit pastry for dessert.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,20
82099,"There's a bit of spritz and very light flavors of fresh pear. A lick of honey winds through and continues on into the finish, offsetting a slightly bitter note.",85,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,18
108017,"This Merlot currently offers a dry palate and firm tannins. As it warms in the glass, subtle blackberry, cola and pepper notes emerge. It's pretty tightly wound for a Merlot, but it's attractively priced and should soften with a little time to breathe.",86,US,California,Merlot,15
63055,"Brander's stainless steel fermented Sauvignon is an exciting wine, simply brilliant in pure fruit and mouthwatering acidity. It's as fresh as a harvest morning, with intense flavors of lemongrass, gooseberry, tangerine zest, green grass and vanilla. Certainly at the top of its class.",93,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,30
68071,"An elegant blend from different estate vineyards, this widely available cuvée brings sturdy tannins and red currant fruit, highlighted with pretty baking spices. It would be an ideal match for roast duck with an orange sauce.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,54
37981,"A good Rhône-style white blend of Roussanne and Viognier. It's very rich in tangerine, white peach, mango, honey and vanilla flavors, yet balanced with minerality and a clean sweep of acidity. Finishes a little sweet, but not too much.",87,US,California,Rhône-style White Blend,28
112433,"Showing the superb structure of the vintage and the spectacular way this great vineyard can ripen Pinot Noir, this polished wine is not only delicious from the get-go, but ageable. Floods the mouth with lush black cherry, red currant, cola, sweet oak, anise, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on. A memorable wine that should slowly gather steam and peak by 2011, then begin a long, steady arc downward.",97,US,California,Pinot Noir,54
63122,"Good fruit in this tannic mountain wine. Shows classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. But it's tough and hard, and also acidic. Doesn't have the balance for the long haul, so drink now–2012.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,30
126582,"From the renowned vineyard's F Block comes a wine with plump wild berries, pencil lead and juniper on a tightly woven nose. Certain to last for years and evolve steadily over that time, the palate now shows lavender, elderberry, elderflower, cranberry essence and a touch of black tea. Drink 2018–2028.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,55
52261,"Price be damned, this is an authentically gorgeous, important Cabernet Sauvignon. It calls to mind the amazing 2001, with its huge, perfect tannins and acids and artistic appliqué of new oak. But the star of the show surely is the fruit. Mounds of ripe blackberries and cherries pile up, veering into currants and cassis and something wild and decadently animal, like charred meat. Fabulous now despite the firm tannins, and should evolve for many years.",97,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,225
147643,"There's a hint of cherry in the mid-palate, and the wine delivers simple pleasures. Nothing fancy, but nothing wrong.",84,US,Oregon,Merlot,10
61214,"This intensely aromatic Riesling bursts with cheese rind and apple cider. Elegant, fruity and dry. Pair it with Thai food.",87,US,California,Riesling,18
43855,"Still young, steely and firm, but classy and deep. This has the best attributes of the '05 and '06 Columbia Valley Cabs from Seven Hills—ripe and polished black fruits, firm tannins, a supple finish with a veneer of smoke and licorice. In other words, this is a complete, complex and intriguing Bordeaux blend, with plenty of aging potential.",91,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
52549,"Buttered toast and caramel corn dominate this Chardonnay, which also features ripe pineapple and golden mango flavors. It's made in the popular style of ripe, oaky fruitiness.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,19
88958,"The nose on this bottling is full of fresh Asian pear aromas along with hints of guava and ripe oranges, showing restraint from a warmer climate. There's a good sizzle of acidity to start the sip, with flavors of poached pear, apple cream and citrus rinds rounding out the palate.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,29
13889,"This blend of 42% Syrah, 31% Petite Sirah, 20% Zinfandel and 7% Grenache from the Templeton Gap area shows aromas of grape soda, pencil lead, sweet violets and effervescent cola, all fun yet elegantly restrained. Blueberry, black pepper and fresh purple fruit combine for a very lively wine, with strong acidity on the palate.",91,US,California,Red Blend,42
119117,"Relatively low in alcohol (12.2% is the listing), this is thin on fruit but does offer soft flavors of yeasty bread dough, along with some stemmy tannins.",82,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,24
33729,"This is a linebacker wine, at 15.7% abv, bursting with roasted coffee, licorice and dry tannins all around. Soft, supple and round, and fully concentrated, the finish could use a bit more harrumph. The back label's suggestion to pair this wine with short ribs is a good call.",86,US,California,Petite Sirah,35
2808,"Cherry, raspberry and vanilla combine for an inviting mix of ripeness and sweet bouquet. A fruity component also sits nicely atop this structured wine marked by soft, fine tannins. The finish is robust in black pepper and clove.",87,US,California,Merlot,15
18601,"This tastes a bit on the sweet side, with flavors of white sugar, orange, lemon, lime and vanilla. Fortunately, there's a cut of crisp acidity that lends balance. The grapes come mainly from Lake County and Paso Robles.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,12
107135,"There is a lot of promise in this bottling from a single vineyard 1,200 feet above the Malibu coast. Baked blackberry, red plum and sultry strawberry notes appear alongside savory roasted beef and herbs. There's enough pepper on the palate to indicate Syrah, but the fruit is lighter than usual, with bramble and raspberry lifted by touches of fennel and dill.",89,US,California,Syrah,30
108658,"What a nice wine for bistro-style drinking. Conjures up pairing with almost everything, from tempura to grilled chicken to pork enchiladas. Bone dry and crisp, it offers outstanding flavors of citrus fruits, petrol, wildflowers, grass, minerals, honey and spices. A blend of Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Canelli and Chenin Blanc.",89,US,California,White Blend,10
40544,"Good price for a Cabernet this elegant and classy. It's not an something for the cellar, but offers everything it has now, with ripe blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors that are wrapped into sturdy, smooth tannins.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
68880,"Il Nonno is a very small-production blend of Sangiovese (59%), Cabernet Sauvignon (26%), Cabernet Franc (10%) and Petite Sirah (5%). It is remarkably black in color and a touch dull on the nose, made to be super Tuscan in style with blackberry and mushroom that perhaps went into hiding. The wine's bitter finish isn't great.",85,US,California,Red Blend,42
80467,"Soft and somewhat rustic, this is a flavorful Pinot Noir, with herb, earth, citrusy acids, leather and quite tart cherry fruit. It would not fit into a textbook definition of classic varietal flavor, but it feels handmade, and it is light years beyond much of the corporate plonk being labeled Pinot Noir these days.",86,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,20
19546,"A big, savory Syrah from Mendocino's well-known Eaglepoint Ranch that's been aged in neutral oak but retains layers of tar and caramel on the finish. Let this wine open before pairing it with rich, meaty fare.",88,US,California,Syrah,42
89348,"Off-dry with a candied orange character, this is indeed a mélange, including portions of seven different white wine grapes. It's an interesting wine, though might prove a bit challenging to match to food. Perhaps a curry?",86,US,Washington,White Blend,15
127692,"Sweet and jammy fruit flavors suggest canned cherry and plum. That sweetness is offset by the drying, earthy tannins and flavor of dried herb.",87,US,Washington,Zinfandel,30
101559,"Woody and herbal, this full-bodied robust wine is approachably thick and round, with distinct characteristics of forest floor, mushroom and black tea.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,45
5222,"Generous and fruit-driven, this brings fully ripened black cherry and blueberry fruit into a thick core of flavor. Its tannins are coated with espresso, dark chocolate and a hint of baking spices. Flavors are solid and substantial, and the wine will continue to evolve nicely as it sheds its baby fat.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,55
11477,"This wine shows intense bittersweet tobacco and dried herb flavors, wrapped in a subtle greenness. Dense and rich, it presents its ripe and full-bodied weight with a leathery texture on the palate.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,62
104351,"Dry, creamy and crisp in acidity, this has rich pineapple, lemon, lime and buttered toast flavors. It's easy to drink and enjoy.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,20
26624,"A beautiful Pinot Noir. So dry and elegant, so light and crisp in the mouth, and yet so complex. Continues a string of impressive wines from this remote vineyard. Shows mineral-inflected cherry, currant and cola flavors, in a full-bodied wine with great density and finish. Now–2016, at least.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,54
106364,"Tobacco and tar stand out in this densely packed, robustly built estate, 100% varietal wine. Full bodied, it's a study in dark chocolate and smoked meats, wrapped in oak and black pepper. There's some serious power to this wine.",91,US,California,Syrah,32
91183,"Easy to like now for its rich, exuberant flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, pomegranates, persimmons and oak that are so delectable through the spicy finish. Dry and silky, it's a Pinot Noir made for pairing with a smoky, grilled steak. Best now and for 3–5 years.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
111983,"Concentrated hibiscus and rose petals are cut by an iron minerality and anise character on the nose of this wine that Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton make for a Japanese partner. It's rich on the palate but still just medium weight, showing graphite, Asian spices, black peppercorns and lots of textural energy and acidic verve on the palate.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,68
58748,"Much different from last year's bottling, and better, but also more expensive. It's a big, rich, Rhônish Pinot that requires some age to calm down. Shows tannic flavors of cherries, blackberries, cola, anise, sassafras and sandalwood.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,36
128662,"Aromas of berry, coffee, herbs and smoke lead to dark fruit flavors with a layered, supple feel. It's a good find at this price.",90,US,Washington,Syrah,18
105336,"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,80
132061,"A big, bold and beautiful Cabernet. Will appeal to those who like the California style, although Bordeauxphiles will find it too ripe and fruity. Brims with blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and sweet toasted oak, wrapped into firm, mountain tannins. Now–2014.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
53482,"It's quite tannic, as is to be expected from this founding Red Mountain vineyard, and yet the wine seems smoothed over, buffed out. The black cherry and cassis fruit does not penetrate. Drink up.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
75977,"Very extracted and ripe, this wine's voluptuous cherry, currant, licorice and spice flavors are compromised by excessive softness. Doesn't show much complexity beyond the fruit, so drink now.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
56915,"Fresh-squeezed apple juice, grapefruit spritzer and nearly sweet cherry aromas sit atop minerality on the nose of this blend of 46% Viognier, 19% Verdelho, 19% Vermentino and 16% Sauvignon Blanc. There's a lot of tart acidity, with a lingering apple flavor.",91,US,California,White Blend,16
33486,"You can call this wine country-style because it's a simple little Zin, but it has a certain charm. Drink it with a nice pizza or meatball hoagie and enjoy the black raspberry and pepper flavors.",85,US,California,Zinfandel,24
32234,"This wine smells like an ice cream sundae, with scents of mint-chocolate chip and cookie dough, plus touches of strawberry and cherry sauce. Light to medium bodied, it has a malleable midpalate, but the tannins gain astringency on the finish. As the wine sits in the glass, the fruit seems to fall away, and the palate becomes more brittle feeling.",83,US,Virginia,Cabernet Franc,26
31593,"This all-out Zin makes no bones about its sweetness, heavy oak spiciness and full body. Maple syrup, brown sugar and cherry jam are the dominant notes that crowd the aromas and flavors and linger on the finish. Very rich and full-bodied, it has prominent caramelized oak notes that keep the tannins from biting.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,16
117526,"A beautifully floral Viognier, its aromas tenderly inviting, with uplifting hints of apricot, pear and white fig. It's a deftly made white with lovely minerality and a fleshy mouthfeel all wrapped up in the end with a light touch of lemon.",90,US,California,Viognier,20
149778,"This winery does a fine job with this unusual, rustic red grape. Heavy, juicy black cherry fruit anchors an earthy, tannic wine, giving it a ripe, solid core to hang the tannins on.",89,US,Oregon,Maréchal Foch,14
23806,"This blend of 50% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Malbec, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc shows cocoa dust, leather, beef jerky, dried blueberries and boysenberries on the nose. The palate is dense with tarry fruit notes, offering dark elderberries and smoked beef flavors.",89,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,52
28798,"Punchy and bright with tones of honey, pineapple and quince, this medium-sweet Riesling is an alarm clock to the senses. Juicy and forward, with a streak of sunny, lemon acidity, it's a straightforward but unabashedly satisfying quaffer.",88,US,New York,Riesling,17
104044,"Bill Easton's Mourvèdre features a combination of bright, ripe strawberry and savory herbal tea. It is medium bodied, with a distinctly peppery finish.",88,US,California,Mourvèdre,25
7516,"This is a rich, inviting wine with characteristics of dried cranberry and red currant, replete with dusty, spicy tannins and spicy, spiked vanilla. Lush, the tannins are soft and supple, a tad smoky, and the secondary elements darker in smoke, black licorice and espresso. Burly, it's balanced and refined.",92,US,California,Merlot,55
12511,"This is Primitivo-Barbera blend with dabs of Nebbiolo and Dolcetto in the mix. It's light and youthful, with cranberry fruit and the sort of juicy acidity that freshens the palate. Not especially concentrated, but crisp and clean, with a bracing minerality.",86,US,Washington,Red Blend,18
48170,"A simple, soft and slightly sweet wine, with ripe flavors of berries, currants, cola and funky leather. Cabernet, Sangiovese and Petite Sirah.",82,US,California,Red Blend,38
2280,"Slightly funky scents of asphalt and sweaty socks come along with graphite, pressed blackberry and New Mexico chile. The palate is led by tobacco-laced zing, opening with boysenberry flavors, and finishing with decent acidity and mouth-coating tannins.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
33602,"Stainless steel fermented and aged Chardonnay (eg ‘naked') is becoming commonplace, but few offer as much snap and juicy fruitiness as this one. It's a great, round mouthful of grape juice, crisp green apple and suggestions of pineapple and citrus. A little fresh herb rounds out the finish.",88,US,Washington,Chardonnay,11
75851,"Toast and butterscotch flavors lead the way in this relatively full-bodied wine, featuring a fine array of crisp apple, peach, pear, melon and citrus notes. Long and full on the finish. Best Buy.",90,US,New York,Chardonnay,13
117572,"This is a worthy followup to the 2004. It's softly silky and dryly elegant, a creamy, complex wine with luscious red currant, cola, licorice and mocha flavors. Made largely from Dijon clones, it's best now for its juicy youthfulness.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
118314,"This is a Right Bank-style blend of 62% Merlot and 38% Cabernet Franc. It shows impressive structure and clear varietal components from both grapes. Tannins are fine-grained and lead into a lingering streak of smooth, coffee-coated flavors.",92,US,Oregon,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,38
50529,"Bright, clean, crisply rendered raspberry fruit—nicely spiced—really shines here. This relatively modestly priced cuvée carries itself with style and elegance, still young, tight and tart, with plenty of medium-term aging potential.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,24
55986,"This is a tasty, juicy, easy-drinking wine with good fruit flavors. Well balanced and medium bodied, it offers some of the density and texture expected, but without going over the top in tannins.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,24
70320,"This is Ferrari-Carano's most upscale wine, a blend comprised of all five of the famous Bordeaux varieties. It's as lush and intricate as almost anything out of Napa, with sumptuous blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The giveaway that it's Sonoma comes in the herbaceousness and slightly greener tannins. Now–2013.",94,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,58
132694,"Bold and striking aromas of mushroom, seaweed and organic funk set this apart from the other Ken Wright vineyard designates. There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,50
45564,"Tightly wound and a little muted, without much fruit on the nose or palate until the finish, which ends sweet. The Cab spent 26 months in barrel and is blended with 1% Petit Verdot.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,22
13866,"Hard to believe this came out of a vineyard as esteemed as Truchard's. The wine is candied, soft and simple, with raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. Maybe it was made from young vines.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,25
110073,"A very rich, ripe, opulent Cabernet, fulsome in blackberries, blueberries, currants and licorice, nicely framed in sweet, smoky oak. Easy to drink now for its soft tannins.",89,US,California,Cabernet,19
81373,"This wine is soft and velvety, awash in classic notes of black currant and berry, textured in full-bodied, oaky waves of toast and cigar box. Approachable on the palate, it winds its way powerfully though softly from start to lengthy finish.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,70
124436,"Here's a big, flashy, cult-style wine if ever there was one. It offers masses of blackberries, black currants, coffee, spices and new oak. Vastly rich, it defines the Harlan Estate style, although, in this vintage, perhaps not quite at its highest expression. Nonetheless the wine is fat and unctuous and immediately drinkable, thanks to refined tannins. Yet it should age effortlessly through 2018.",94,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,500
27847,"This wine starts out strongly reduced, making it a challenge to get at the pink grapefruit, lychee and spice aromas. The flavors drink just off dry, with high wire acidity. There are good things going on but the reduction is a challenge to overcome.",87,US,Washington,Gewürztraminer,25
65886,"More floral, tropical-fruit notes than usual in a Pinot Gris. Quite flowery and rich in the mouth, with flavors of butter, honey and apricot. It's on the dry side, with a hefty jolt of acidity that keeps things clean. Nice cocktail-style wine.",86,US,California,Pinot Gris,16
33913,"Lees aromas mix with notes of custard, poached pear, cinnamon and well-integrated barrel accents. The palate shows a sense of finesse and grace that carries through the finish.",89,US,Washington,Chardonnay,25
54603,"Comes down on the simple, straightforward side, with slightly sweet flavors of spearmint chewing gum, vanilla and lemon and lime soda. Fortunately, the acidity is crisp and cleansing.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
11779,Dainty strokes of crisp-tart raspberry and watermelon rind accent this finely textured rosé. It's a brisk delicately concentrated wine with a brambly lingering finish. Drink now.,88,US,New York,Rosé,18
30700,"It's hard to fall immediately in love with this Cabernet, despite the fancy Oakville address, as the tannins are so firm. But it's dry and clean, and although the tannins are the star—bold and astringent—there's black fruit there, too, to help it along. Drink now.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,19
10133,"Simple and satisfying with lots of ripe pineapple jam, orange sorbet, caramel, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spices, in a creamy texture.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,22
106844,"Don't even think of opening this Cab now. The tannins are hard, and they lock down the considerable blackberry, black currant, anise and dark chocolate flavors. It's a very fine wine. The 100% Cab grapes come from Howell Mountain, Atlas Peak, Mt. Veeder, Rutherford, St. Helena and Coombsville, making this a sort of international citizen of Napa Valley. 2011–2016.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
128010,"A classic Washington tasting-room Riesling—only better. Opulent and fruity, with apricots, star anise, mint, a very nice spicy streak that lifts it up, and adds a lot of complexity. Smooth and supple, it coats the palate, captures some floral highlights, even a bit of marshmallow.",92,US,Washington,Riesling,11
93398,"As delicious as pie filling, with rich black cherry, brown sugar, cocoa, cinnamon, pepper and vanilla flavors. Could use greater tannin-acid structure, though.",87,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,42
84415,"A tasty vein of cranberry and raspberry runs from the nose to the palate, and lingers on the finish, giving this value-priced wine focus and vibrance. It has plenty of fresh acidity, fine tannins and good depth of flavor.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,11
12754,"This wine is quite opulent, and brimming with flavors of new oak, black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate. While the tannins are thick, they're soft enough to drink now.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,250
11281,"Brian Loring makes this spicy wine from a vineyard in the hills overlooking Highway 101 east of Nipomo. Cinnamon powder pumps up aromas of pomegranate, saddle leather and raspberry. It's lively with chai spices and typical cranberry juice at first, then the acidic structure reveals a more savory side, with cherry tomato, tapenade and dried meats on the finish.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
116809,"Light, tannic, leafy and earthy, which is not entirely inappropriate for a $15 Oregon Pinot. The herbal flavors come with the low-rent territory, but the balance and clean sweep of the wine demonstrate David O'Reilly's sure winemaking hand. A well-made budget bottle.",86,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,15
117982,"Built for the cellar, this Cab is impressively deep in ripe currant, cherry, cocoa, milk chocolate and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a brittle astringency, and sweet in oak and fruit on the finish. Best after 2008, and for some years after.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
82151,"Dark-golden colored, this block designate opens in a wealth of butter and wild vanilla, before unveiling interwoven layers of juicy acidity and integrated oak. Gravenstein apple and pear dominate in flavor, adding to the overall succulence and success of this wine.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,37
43588,"This has searing acidity and strong, upfront red-berry and oak flavors. It feels rustictic, but it could be a Cinderella in the making, just waiting to evolve into a princess. If you're a gambler, give it a couple of years in the cellar.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,52
37113,"Comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend displays ripe, round, flavorful fruit, along with a leafy component. The barrel aging has added butterscotch and chocolate notes to the mix. The wine stops just a bit short, but further bottle age may help to lengthen the finish.",88,US,Washington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,37
128554,"Even at nearly 5 years of age, Pietra Santa's is still drily tannic, giving it a puckery astringency. The black and red currant flavors are tasty, but the wine doesn't seem balanced enough to outlive the tannins.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
13921,"This is winemaker Bill Fuller's 41st vintage, hence the designation. It's all Draper clone and spent 10 months in one-third new French oak. The opening aromas carry a volatile edge, then smooth out into fruit flavors of apple and pear. It's a good wine, but the impression of volatility does not entirely dissipate.",89,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,40
73688,"A very expressive and full-bodied wine. It jolts the palate with the purest extract of ripe limes, green apples and minerals. Wonderfully sharp acids push the flavors up and out, and cleanse the palate. Rather lean, compared to some of the fatties out there, a wine of structure and firmness..",91,US,California,Chardonnay,38
10201,"The cold vintage seems to have affected this wine. It lacks its usual richness and instead, is acidic and lean, even vegetal.",82,US,California,Pinot Noir,34
89332,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese is much drier, more acidic and earthier than many other Napa reds. Therein lies its strengh and its weakness. It's a firm wine with suggestions of cherries and tobacco that will satisfy folks who complain about fruit bombs. But it's also pretty tart. Drink now with rich Italian-inspired fare.",87,US,California,Red Blend,65
75366,"A few years of bottle age have softened and mellowed this Chard, making it very nice for drinking now. It has lovely orange, Asian pear and mango flavors, with just the right touch of oak, and a rich, creamy mouthfeel.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,30
98879,"Tastes a bit raw and herbal in the mouth, like a piece of celery, although there are also richer blackberry and cherry flavors. Yet it's a dry, elegantly constructed Cabernet. Best soon, before the fruit disappears.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,52
59263,"Too soft and sweet, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, anise and cocoa. Lacks the acidity and tannic structure to balance the sweetness, but lots of people will savor it anyway.",84,US,California,Syrah,35
68227,"Way too hot for a table wine, with prickly, unpleasant heat, the result of 16.1% alcohol and insufficient fruit.",81,US,California,Syrah,35
29730,"An inky-deep color with a dark red rim hints at the concentration. Enticing aromas from the spice rack, milk chocolate and vanilla lead to meltingly rich fruit and cocoa flavors that are deep and focused. At first sip it's almost sweet with ripe black cherry and black currant notes, but the vivid acidity and layer of fine tannins keep it dry and balanced. It will be best after 2020.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,125
62940,"A nice, Beaune-style Pinot, rich in cherry and spice fruit, with good oak and medium-bodied. It's balanced in acids and tannins, with a smooth mouth feel, a good food wine.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,30
20122,"Strongly flavored, lacking perhaps some nuance but makes up for it in sheer power. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, it wows with blackberry, cassis, blueberry and cherry flavors that finish dry and spicy. A good structure of tannins and acids suggests limited time on the cellar. Drink now through 2014.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,36
49644,This wine sports a green-apple and pear nose with some extra weight from barrel fermentation. Well-balanced and right on the border between stainless- steel and barrel-fermented styles: steel meets butter on the palate. Best Buy.,88,US,Washington,Chardonnay,10
66144,"This pale, peach-colored wine is a blend of Syrah (55%), Sangiovese (28%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of bubble gum and herb lead to a bone-dry palate that seems to have a slight spritz. Tart citrus flavors round it out, with the focus on acidity.",88,US,Washington,Rosé,14
71101,"A great big, oaky wine; it's full-bodied, tannic and incredibly fruity. But the tannins are sweet and softly ripe, and as rich as the fruit is in black cherries, black raspberries, smoky blueberries, mushu plum sauce and carob, there's good acidity to balance it. It all adds up to a totally delicious wine that's ready to drink now.",93,US,California,Syrah,36
27305,"With hard tannins, sharp acids and dry, somewhat austere mouthfeel, this wine, blended with a drop of Malbec, distinguishes itself for its complexity. Blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and espresso flavors combine for interest. Yet the wine doesn't seem to be an ager. It needs rich, fatty meats and cheeses to balance the astringency.",87,US,California,Petit Verdot,65
106335,This blend of Horse Heaven Hills and Red Mountain fruit delivers brooding cherry and herb aromas and full-bodied black cherry flavors. The tannins contribute grit.,88,US,Washington,Mourvèdre,45
40236,"This is a cleaner version of the regular estate Pinot, with bright berry flavors, firm acids, and a certain stiffness to the still-youthful tannins. Fine for medium-term cellaring, or give it a good couple of hours in the decanter.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,28
139999,"A vivid, refreshing blend of 57% Viognier and 43% Pinot Gris seems to bring out the best of both. Viognier's floral, orange and peach scents and flavors are supported by hints of honeysuckle and pear from the Pinot Gris. There is a little spritz to liven up the mouthfeel.",90,US,Washington,White Blend,16
84869,Rich aromas like Anjou pears and rose petals combine with generous ripe pear and vanilla flavors. It feels full-bodied but is light in alcohol and has a soothing texture. Good acidity balances the ripeness and the finish lingers.,88,US,California,White Blend,14
29201,"With cassis and plum aromas, this mid-weight Cabernet Sauvignon from the Foothills has a taste of licorice and vanilla, particularly on the finish, testament to its 33 months in new American oak.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
8489,"Somewhat soft and jammy. While it's certainly delicious, this 100% Cabernet needs greater structure and complexity to add value to the sweet blackberries, cherries and chocolate.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
119692,"The dominant 65% Grenache component makes for a pretty nose of black raspberry, candied berries and elegant violet petals. Thanks to the 35% Syrah, boysenberry, bright strawberry and light raspberry notes meet with darker hibiscus and stronger lavender and savory herbs de provence on the palate.",92,US,California,Grenache-Syrah,55
12288,"With a pretty pink-salmon color, this Pinot Noir-based blush is rich and full-bodied. It has considerable weight for a bubbly, but the acidity and freshness and yeasty tang lift it up to Champagne elegance. Impossible not to fall in love with this raspberry-scented beauty, but why wouldn't you want to?",94,US,California,Sparkling Blend,41
12750,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is so rich and decadent, with milk chocolate, blackberry and new French oak flavors. Made by celebrity winemaker Philippe Melka, it's soft and approacheable on the palate and widely appealing. Your best bet is to drink up now.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,125
53036,"A great example of Lodi Zin, at a great price. Shows real complexity in the blackberry, cherry, mulberry, molasses, cocoa and cola flavors, accented with exotic dusty spices. For all the richness, it's totally dry, and the alcohol level is refreshingly low.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,15
45671,"Not an easy wine to appreciate now. It's tannic, and the fruit is fresh and primary, with the sweet, candied taste of a chewy raspberry twist. Still, there's something complex and interesting going on. It's not just another overripe Zin. Give it a year or two to come around.",89,US,California,Zinfandel,40
127324,"Rustic, with raisiny flavors that finish dry and tart. Drink now.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
82137,"Salty wood and brine show this vineyard's straight shot to the sea, as bright lifted acidity helps to further prove the point. Focused and tense on the palate, there's a sharp, stony minerality that comes into play here, alongside etchings of lemon peel and green apple.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,45
122844,"Quite foamy when poured, this bubbly from the historic sparkling house offers aromas of apple flesh, ripe pears and lemon-lime soda. It presents straightforward flavors on the palate accented with apple blossoms, while white tuberose florals and a touch of guava trend toward the tropical side of the scale.",89,US,California,Sparkling Blend,25
45509,"For the first release of this wine, the oak unfortunately is almost completely overwhelming. Vanilla, green wood, mocha and mint overpower almost any sense of varietal aroma and flavor.",85,US,Washington,Touriga Nacional,20
115105,"Young and strong now, this has lots of primary berry and chocolate flavors. The oak hasn't been integrated into the wine, making it feel rustic, with an emphasis on the tannins and acids. Give it two or three years before opening, but not much more than that.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
100894,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of orange peel, mineral, raspberry and cranberry. The palate is flavorful yet reserved with a lingering fruit-filled finish.",91,US,Washington,Syrah,68
14870,"The wine, from a warm vintage, bursts with fruity charm, but this is a mountain Cab, and while acids are low, you'll find strong tannins. The combination of black currant, cherry, red plum and cocoa flavors with firm, sandpapery tannins is charming and complex. Finishes with a bit of high-alcohol sweetness.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
63498,"You'll find plenty of Pinot Noir character in this wine, which is ultimately simple and for drinking now. It's silky in the mouth, with crisp acids framing cherry, cranberry, cola and oak flavors.",85,US,California,Pinot Noir,25
104334,"Hazelnut, candle wax, dried apple and nectarine aromas show on the nose of this rich and nutty bottling. Similar flavors show on the palate, including dried apples, Meyer lemon, and a honeyed character that lasts into the finish.",87,US,California,Albariño,24
105780,"The flavors of this Cabernet are enormously rich. Blackberry and blueberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and cassis come in waves. Few wines on earth are this ripe. The issue is balance and complexity, both of which could be stronger. Drink over the next few years.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
101415,"A nicely drinkable Chardonnay marked by vigorous acidity and creamy-smooth flavors of pineapple tart, Key lime pie and lemongrass. Good as an inexpensive alternative to coastal bottlings that cost far more.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,18
75058,"Hearty in red plum and raspberry, this smooth, structured Petite is ready to drink now, straightforward rather than complex.",85,US,California,Petite Sirah,18
23391,"Defines Paso Robles Petite Sirah with its soft, luxurious texture and wonderfully ripe fruit. Blackberry and cherry-pie filling, cola, beef jerky and sandalwood flavors flood the mouth, and are perfectly dry and moderate in alcohol. Drink now for sheer lusciousness.",87,US,California,Petite Sirah,30
83079,"Melon and citrus aromas get this soft, ripe and round wine going. The palate is full and plump, with bold citrus and tropical flavors and a welcome textural creaminess. The finish is smooth and supple, and as a whole this wine covers all the bases while showing itself to be a more than capable food accompaniment.",88,US,Oregon,Pinot Gris,10
2596,"Fennel, oak, apple and pear notes blend together in this full-bodied wine with robust structure and richness. Crème brûlée flavors join ginger and nutmeg elements, as the acidity refreshes and rewards.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,45
120606,"Oaky but simple, with smoky, caramel flavors covering thin notes of pineapple sour candy.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,15
64195,"The grapes come from Atlas Peak, and while the wine is dry, it's very soft, which gives the ultraripe apricots and peaches a syrupy taste. The caramelly oak adds to the feeling of heaviness.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,45
125719,"This is from 30-year-old Wente clone vines, a crisply elegant, almost all stainless-fermented Chardonnay with a tight structure, underlying minerality and a zesty, lime-inflected flavor.",88,US,Washington,Chardonnay,20
103014,"Ripe and fruity, this is a Chardonnay that will appeal to fans of the modern style. Brims with pineapples, lemons, limes and green apples, with a touch of vanilla cream.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,14
139932,"Seems a bit pricey for what you get, which is a dry, clean red table wine with sturdy tannins and good cherry, herb, cocoa and oak flavors. At its best now, this Merlot will complement beef and lamb dishes",85,US,California,Merlot,26
44147,"This is Wine Guerilla's most costly Zin and also their best, most Zinny one. It's textbook Dry Creek Valley. Dry, rich and high in alcohol but balanced, it offers waves of grilled wild berry, mocha, red licorice, raisin, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors, wrapped into gorgeous tannins.",92,US,California,Zinfandel,35
95369,"Generous tannins give this wine power and weight, as bright bursts of red cherry and inviting vanilla notes give it a counterpoint of focus. Softly textured, it's an exploration of brambly blackberry flavors, baking in the summer sun.",90,US,California,Zinfandel,56
54445,"Now sourced from the estate vineyard on Red Mountain, this exceptional rosé includes portions of Counoise, Cinsault and Grenache. Though the pale, coppery pink shade suggests a light wine, this is fragrant and full-bodied, with salmonberry and strawberry fruit, light spice and excellent length.",90,US,Washington,Rosé,16
14640,"A delicious, easy-drinking Pinot Noir for everyday, at a good price. It has raspberry tutti-fruity flavors with lots of vanilla and spice.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,12
91437,"Easy to like this crisp, fruity bubbly. A classic blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it has rich, candied flavors of raspberries, cherries, tangerines, vanilla and cinnamon spice, with the yeasty tang of a fine sparkling wine.",87,US,California,Champagne Blend,23
46255,"Tart, with an acidic mouthfeel that intrudes on the ripe cherry, red currant and cola flavors. Could be a bit more mellow. May develop for a few years, but that sharpness isn't likely to go away.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,50
128968,"Principally Cabernet Franc with small amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec (8% each) blended in, this wine is almost irresistible with its pretty, pale salmon color. It does not disappoint with its aromas and flavors of melon, white peach and grapefruit, with a light spritz giving it some lift.",91,US,Washington,Rosé,17
17120,"One of the richer Pinots out there, just packed with ripe raspberries and cherries, like the filling in a pie. Shows great, cool-climate acidity, and the texture is as light and silky as can be. Defines the best of a drink-now style.",89,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
2349,"Fresh in zingy, ripe blackberry flavor, this well-made Zin has firm tannins and a dollop of peppery spice on the finish.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,17
1444,"A partnership between the Delicato Family and country musician Zac Brown, this well-made wine shows a wealth of flavor and complexity, from dusty saddle and earth to black cherry and berry. Muscular and dense, it reveals plenty of underlying structure and grace, with a bright sprinkling of spicy pepper on the finish. Drink ideally between 2020 and 2023.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,120
128293,"Thick and viscous in the glass, this densely loaded wine shows buttery, vanilla-laced French toast on the nose as well as black cherry, blackberry, crushed lavender and marjoram notes. The round palate is relatively tight with elderberry, espresso and black-peppercorn flavors, lifted elegantly by purple flowers.",92,US,California,Petite Sirah,48
107520,"This is soft, fruity and very approachable, with flavors of strawberry jam. Highlights of sassafras and a pleasing spiciness add texture and interest.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,40
115627,"A vivid yellow-gold color grabs the attention and creamy, tropical fruit flavors deliver the goods in this medium-bodied but full-blown wine. Pineapple, grapefruit, fig and almond are layered in an almost unctuous texture, but supported by vibrant acidity that keeps everything in great balance.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,65
36420,"An interesting and quite good Cabernet Sauvignon for drinking now. It's soft and melted in the mouth, with rich, complex waves of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise, dusted with briary herbs and spices.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
69903,"The Cab is matched against Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot in a slightly less intense version of the becoming quite fashionable in Washington State. The best percentage seems to be about 60% Cab to 40% Syrah, roughly the blend here, which contrasts the Cab's firm, tannic, lightly herbal character with the tart blueberry and winery's exceptional Intuition reserve. Similar flavors are here, complex and lingering, just slightly less concentration.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
104669,"Ripe and seemingly sweet fruit, oak and spice characterize this rich, delicious Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's strong tannins, but here they're soft and melted. The flavors include blackberry jam and mocha.",88,US,California,Petite Sirah,35
81577,"They muscled up this Sangiovese with some Cabernet, which gives it a fuller body and sturdier tannins than usual. Nonetheless, it has Sangiovese's silkiness and red cherry and leather flavors.",89,US,California,Sangiovese,60
107573,"This easy-drinking Riesling finishes dry, but still it's relatively soft, with green apple fruit and some spicy skin phenolics. Good balance and gentle persistence through a clean finish.",88,US,Washington,Riesling,20
90123,"Thin and simple, this is not rich enough to stand up to all of the acidity, lending it a sour taste.",82,US,California,Pinot Noir,20
42116,"This is the driest of Iron Horse's new releases, but it still has a honeyed richness even though the residual sugar is a comparatively low half a percent. It feels refined, fancy and elegant, with delicious raspberry, lime and toast flavors. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay.",93,US,California,Sparkling Blend,50
140202,"Firm and spicy, with a lovely spine of tight flavors running right through the middle of the palate. Light fruits—strawberry, rhubarb, melon and red plum—lead through a long, elegant finish.",88,US,Washington,Merlot,28
71489,"There's no other blend of Carignan, Pinot Noir, Gewürz, Syrah and several other varieties, so far as I know. The wine is dry, with crisp acidity and deep cherry and raspberry flavors. It's not complicated, but it's fun.",87,US,California,Red Blend,25
130763,"A big, bold, exuberantly rich wine, classic Williams Selyem Chard. The underlying wine is all pineapples, peaches, pears and exotic tropical fruits, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast, caramel, nougat and vanilla. Acidity is high, which will help the wine age through 2013.",95,US,California,Chardonnay,50
24974,"While earthy on the nose, the palate of this stainless-steel fermented Tocai offers pretty, primary flavors of apricot, tangerine and rose-petal jam. Luscious in body and texture, it's soft in acidity and finishes with a touch of warmth on the finish.",87,US,New York,Tocai Friulano,20
91234,"Sweet in oak and simple, with jammy apricot, pineapple and gingerbread flavors.",84,US,California,Chardonnay,24
137090,Way too oaky. The underlying fruit is not nearly strong enough to support all that caramel and buttered toast. The result is clumsy.,81,US,California,Chardonnay,28
30345,"A blend of fruit from Boushey, Ciel du Cheval and Seven Hills vineyards, this wine opens with aromas of plum, Asian spices, licorice, dark fruit and light barrel spices. The palate is rich, full bodied and velvety, with abundant coffee flavors and a mesmerizing sense of texture.",92,US,Washington,Grenache,50
127083,"This is a fresh, vibrant stainless steel-fermented Chard that boasts charming notes of fresh apple slices, nectarine, lemon rind citrus and a hint of yellow florals. It's ripe and big without being too spicy or overdone, with a solid, lengthy finish. Drink now.",86,US,New York,Chardonnay,19
51521,"Shows the brilliantly etched fruit and brisk acidity that mark an Edna Valley white wine. Tremendous in citrus and wintergreen flavors, its mouth-cleansing quality makes it ideal for an appetizer. Or try with Asian-style poultry and pork dishes.",88,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,13
93310,"Soft and sugary sweet, with apricot, tangerine and citron flavors, this is a pretty, fairly simple wine. Good for drinking at picnics, with ham, fruit salad.",84,US,California,Moscato,8
126280,"From an emerging region above the Los Angeles basin, this bottling offers a familiar nose of candied blackberry and gamy lamb. The palate is bursting with acidity and shows tart black fruits.",84,US,California,Syrah,25
72919,"Made by Aaron Pott from a 600-foot elevation site, this is a crisp and quite floral wine. It's rich and concentrated on the palate, with a lemony overlay of zesty acidity. Nutmeg and vanilla pierce the finish, providing a warmth to the wine.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,38
78096,"The winery's Kit's Killer is a dependably good Cabernet, almost always showing lots of richness and complexity. They raised the price by $2 since last vintage, but it's still a very fine wine, with delicious blackberry, currant and licorice flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Drink over the next few years.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
6059,"Ripe, rich black cherry and plum flavors are struck by ripples of coffee, dried herbs and granite in this elegant, structured Cabernet Franc. Crisp acidity and fine grained tannins frame a moderately long finish.",89,US,New York,Cabernet Franc,25
26425,"With apricot, orange, peach, lemon and lime flavors, this is one of the richer Sauvignon Blancs out there. But it's totally dry, with brisk acidity and a clean, elegant finish.",88,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
148216,"Four different clones are separately fermented and then blended to make this unique bottling. An expansive nose shows vibrant pineapple, peach, and orange fruit with lemondrop and butterscotch accents. It's rich and mouthfilling, like a bite of banana cream pie, and turns maybe a bit orangey-sweet. Shy on subtlety, it packs in a lot of juicy flavor.",89,US,California,Chardonnay,33
93682,"One hundred percent varietal, this vineyard designated Merlot seems a casualty of the cool 2010 growing season with prominent herbal notes, tart plum flavors, and astringent tannins.",84,US,Washington,Merlot,18
23062,"All the parts are here to make this Pinot a lovely companion to appropriate beef, pork and game dishes, especially if wild mushrooms are involved. The wine is utterly dry and bright in acidity, and the tannins are fairly thick for a Pinot Noir. The black cherry, pomegranate, leather, black pepper and sandalwood flavors are appealing now, but the wine should develop bottle complexity until 2020.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
78631,"Baking-spice, dark-chocolate, vanilla and cocoa aromas resonate on this barrel-forward wine. The palate brings luscious dark-fruit and dark-chocolate flavors, with grainy tannins backing it up. It shows some warmth on the finish.",87,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,28
13126,"Tart cherry flavor meets firm tannins and chalky texture in this robust, ripe and brawny red. Full bodied and richly concentrated, it holds its ripeness in check.",87,US,California,Zinfandel,36
119037,"Very limited, 100% varietal, this estate-grown Malbec has high-toned aromas and tangy purple berry flavors. Anise and stone streak into the finish; overall a good effort, with fairly light fruit and an herbal undertone.",87,US,Washington,Malbec,40
29213,"There's nothing at all French about this Cab. It could only come from California, with its jammy, soft black cherry and chocolate flavors.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,30
30653,"Vanilla, tobacco and anise flavors quickly overwhelm the fruit; perhaps the wine just needs to breathe longer. At first taste, it quickly turns tannic and very drying; the fruit is buried and the oak flavors are still a bit jarring and disjointed.",85,US,Washington,Syrah,15
105105,"Big and brawny, this is dry and hard in tannins, as Nickel & Nickel wines tend to be in youth. This one, from a cool section of southern Napa Valley, is brisk in acids, making it rather closed now. But it has a gigantic core of blackberries, with a delicious edge of dark chocolate. Merlot is a difficult wine to age in California, but this one should improve over the next five years, maybe longer.",93,US,California,Merlot,50
55350,"The color is absolutely black, except for royal purple at the rim of the glass. That just begins to suggest this wine's power. It's saturated in blackberry jam, black currants and chocolate, wrapped into huge tannins. The overall balance is fine, with a squirt of citrusy acidity. This wine defines a well-made California Petite Sirah, with Napa elegance. Fine to drink now with rich beef dishes and cheeses, and will live for decades, gradually shedding tannins and growing finer and sweeter.",92,US,California,Petite Sirah,40
115389,This wine is already in solid shape for near-term drinking. Black cherry fruit of medium weight is annotated with whiffs of smoke and coffee. It's fine for opening now through 2020.,88,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
91643,"Extremely tight, clean and minerally aromas of chalk, citrus pith and lemongrass make for a very crisp and fresh nose on this white wine bottling of the typically red Grenache grape. The palate is just as zesty, with apple skin, green papaya and underripe mango flavors, showing flashes of tropicality while remaining light and tight.",92,US,California,Grenache,20
14619,"Initial wafts of cannabis-like herbs quickly emerge into lime pith, limestone, struck match and oyster shells, with white flowers and yeastiness showing as well. There's a vivid tension between tart apple flesh and citrus pith on the palate, with lemon curd and pineapple elements arriving over time. Sit on this until 2017 so the acid can mellow, then drink through 2027.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,60
48856,"Smoky, with traces of cherry and vanilla, this is a heavily tannic version of the variety, seemingly aged in full-strength oak. Aromas are elusive and the finish brief.",83,US,California,Pinot Noir,23
43022,"Strong in tannins and showing an earthy, tough aggressiveness, this Cabernet lacks immediate charm. There's an old-fashioned dryness about it, rather like the old Inglenooks and Louis Martinis that aged forever. Perhaps it will, too. There's a big, ripe heart of blackberries, and no apparent reasons why the wine shouldn't glide through the years.",89,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,52
17245,"This shows that apricotty, botrytised aroma and flavor often found in Santa Lucia Chardonnays from the cooler parts of the appellation, but it's not at all sweet. Instead, it's a bone-dry wine, with vibrant acidity.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,40
63585,"Quite shy in aromas at first, the nose on this wine focuses on apple candies, lime blossoms and Anjou pear juice. The palate shows slightly sour apples and tangy lime juice, with a crisp pear backbone.",86,US,California,Viognier,30
150763,"Great vineyards, great winery, great vintage: There's lots to like about this big, bold, fruity wine that manages to be complex and elegant at the same time. Masses of blackberry, black currant and violets, with smoke and vanilla from oak aging. What's hard to convey is the balance, richness, harmony and depth of flavor, which are really stunning. Age it for a few years if you want, but it's at or near its delicious best now.",93,US,California,Merlot,35
23356,"Celebrity chef Florence, in partnership with Rob Mondavi, from Folio Fine Wine Partners, has crafted this delicious, zesty Sauvignon Blanc. It's so rich in kiwi, lime, tangerine, wildflower, vanilla and mineral flavors, it's practically a food group in itself, but bright acidity grounds and balances it. Great job at a good price.",90,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
20853,"Limited production, tight and interesting. This 100% Petite Sirah is one of just a handful of varietal versions of the grape made in Washington. It features ripe berry flavors—blueberry in particular—wrapped in well-managed tannins with hints of caramel running through the finish. Still young, primary fruit, with a sharp edge to the tannins. Give it a couple more years in the cellar for optimal drinking.",88,US,Washington,Petite Sirah,20
18407,"Soft and sweet, a simple country-style wine with cherry jam flavors as well as a streak of wintergreen mint.",84,US,California,Mourvèdre,25
51380,"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging. Despite the richness, there's a firm minerality, a tang of steel that makes the wine bracing. The grapes are from a vineyard in the southerly, cool Coombsville area, an area that needs its own appellation.",94,US,California,Chardonnay,35
116146,"This 100% varietal and barrel-fermented wine is a remarkable study in power and grace. Black cherry, cigar box and cedar bark flavors and an invitingly sweet sensation of tannin are supported by bright, lingering acidity and supple complexity.",97,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,250
71248,"These grapes come from a variety of vineyards scattered widely across the state, but they add up to a 98% pure Cabernet Sauvignon, intense, dark, plummy, rich and full-bodied. It's got all the grape's key component flavors on display: olive, light herb, and juicy purple fruits. The oak is still coming into focus, with strong notes of vanilla and clove. Give it a few hours breathing time.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,18
128618,"The combination of high alcohol and what tastes like residual sugar makes this Zinfandel rather sugary sweet. If that's your style, you'll like the jammy raspberries, cherries and spices.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,18
89430,"Elegant structure on this wine, with a graceful silkiness, although it's a bit lacking in concentration, especially at this price. Shows jammy cherry, raspberry and spice flavors, with a coating of smoky oak.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
11552,"Medicinal, pungent pine-needle scents continue into the main palate. This shows barely any trace of varietal character.",82,US,Oregon,Syrah,35
119585,"This tastes overripe and Port-like. The flavors are of raisins, currants, licorice and sweet caramelized oak. This is unlikely to evolve positively, so drink now.",85,US,California,Syrah,35
51694,"This is a very delicious Pinot, made in a drink-me-now style. It's dry and crisp and silky, and enormously rich in raspberry, cherry and strawberry jam flavors. The texture is pure silk and satin. Drink now for sheer lusciousness.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,53
135593,"Much the same as the winery's Pinot Gris, this unoaked Chardonnay has very green fruit flavors—tart crunchy green apple with plenty of acidity.",85,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,15
78081,"Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay for those who like these strong, direct hits. It's powerful in tropical fruit, citrus, pear and green apple flavors, with a creamy overlay of buttery oak. Drink now.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,22
34802,"A witch's brew of five grapes, the Abondante is a fine wine to pair with pizza, offering interesting flavors of berry and stone fruit. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for with plenty of fruit and some unusual complexity.",88,US,Washington,Red Blend,24
61077,"Merryvale's Profile has been one of the most reliable Bordeaux blends for a long time, and the '03, which is mainly Cab Sauvignon, is a very fine expression of the house style. A blend of impressive vineyards, it's opulent in black currant flavors, and is most notable for its softly elegant balance. It's the kind of wine that will dazzle even people who say they don't like reds. Best now–2011 or so.",93,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,95
143365,"The name plays on the fact that the winery owners are in the legal profession. It's a blend is a fine value, capturing the rugged, juicy quality of Barrister's vintage wines, and smoothing out some rougher tannins with a little extra time in bottle. The tannins are in fact rough, but justice is ultimately served, as this excellent value should be.",87,US,Washington,Red Blend,19
150297,"Ripe and buttery, this reserve Chard from winemaker Eric Fry could hardly be more different from his White Label bottling. Superripe pineapple fruit is marked by plenty of oak-imparted spice. Lush and ready to drink.",87,US,New York,Chardonnay,25
18122,"The grape is Scheurebe, grown in Germany and Austria, a variety that lends itself to dessert wines. The wine is lush, with honey, apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors. It's a little soft for such sweetness, but superdelicious.",89,US,California,Scheurebe,50
118317,"With a dusty, cola-like quality, this flirty Mourvèdre gets better and better over time in the glass, unveiling layers of floral, earthy and wild raspberry notes sprinkled with a suggestion of gamy meat. With firm, chewy tannins and a mouth-coating texture, it showcases El Dorado's decomposed granite soils and the prowess of the winemaker with these grapes.",92,US,California,Mourvèdre,30
138522,"A stiff, tightly structured wine that could pass for Cabernet Sauvignon in most parts of the world. Cranberry and raspberry fruit vies with herb, black olive and dark smoky tannins for palate dominance. This is a wine to savor and to cellar.",92,US,Washington,Merlot,36
115700,"The Grisant Pinot Gris is more full and fleshy than the winery's LEHM bottling, but still a bit one dimensional. Pleasant flavors of pear fruit, skin phenolics and light suggestions of cinnamon.",86,US,Washington,Pinot Gris,18
51305,"Notes of apple, yellow peach and pear are savory in tone in this unoaked Chardonnay. Dry in style, it's delicately concentrated with soft tangerine acidity. The finish is brisk but clean.",86,US,New York,Chardonnay,21
10406,"Sourced exclusively from the Ciel du Cheval Vineyard, this pure Roussanne is fragrant with bright scents of apple and citrus. The fruit is set in an elegant frame of mineral-infused acids, and it stretches out on the palate into a lengthy, polished, refreshing finish.",91,US,Washington,Roussanne,34
92418,"Nicely perfumed with a musky/grapey scent, this low alcohol (10.4%) sweet Riesling is pleasant and clean, but a bit attenuated. It has plenty of sugary honey and some simple canned peach fruit, but stops there.",85,US,Washington,Riesling,12
96976,"Some new oak lends a sweet, smoky edge of buttered toast to this ripe Chardonnay. Its pineapple and pear flavors are highlighted by crisp acidity.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,20
75172,"Amidst pungent layers of smoke and toast, there's a core of clean, red cherry and plum flavors accented by black coffee and milk chocolate notes. Lean, lively acidity and well-integrated tannins add structure.",86,US,New York,Cabernet Franc,40
99122,"There is a sharpness to the aroma, a pungent mix of pineapple and pine needle, that leads into a fairly light palate with lemon oil, citrus fruit and a hint of orange hard candy. Residual sugar near 2% helps balance out the acidity. The wine tastes a bit like a Vouvray—the same sweet/sour tension.",88,US,Oregon,Riesling,19
79080,"There are lots of delicious flavors in this smooth blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. It impresses for its voluptuous flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and sweet oak. It could be a little firmer in structure; it's soft and melted, like pastry filling.",87,US,California,Red Blend,46
88035,"A mighty fine white wine. Fills the much-needed niche of extreme dryness, acidity and restraint, which are the hallmarks of elegance. Call it the anti-Chardonnay. A Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend with some barrel and sur lie influence, it's rich and crisp in Meyer lemon, pear, fig, vanilla and smoky butter flavors.",93,US,California,White Blend,25
113069,"Floral aromas like rose and lilac give this lush and fruity wine a unique character. It has very ripe, exotic fruit flavors that resemble blueberries, macerated cherries and boysenberries. Subtle oak nuances form a lightly spicy background, while firm tannins add grip to complete a nicely balanced and high-intensity package.",92,US,California,Primitivo,28
57971,"A 100% varietal wine, this is both soft and dense, herbal and restrained in cranberry and red currant. Dry and dusty, the body is medium to full bodied, and the finish medium-long. Enjoy now.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
22279,"It's too bad that this blend of 75% Zinfandel, 12% Cabernet Franc and 13% Syrah is only found in Bermuda. Elderberry, tobacco and blueberry-stuffed chocolate power the dense nose, yet the palate shows a fresh lightness, with mint and menthol lifting the cherry juice and tannic grip that structures the sip.",92,US,California,Red Blend,34
14802,"This is a reserved and elegant example, fashioned along European lines. There's mixed vegetable and tomato notes upfront and a juicy palate of red fruit rounded out by a vanilla top note. The medium finish shows soft tannins. Serve with firm cheese. Drink now to 2011.",87,US,New York,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,11
106464,"The Select bottling, which appears to be TeBri's reserve, shows medium concentration, with strawberry and cherry flavors. Cola, earth, caramel and chocolate notes come together on the pretty finish.",87,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,36
79556,"Soft and sweet in fruit and honey, like a dessert pastry, with a clean scour of acidity. It's rich and long in pineapple, orange, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors.",86,US,California,Grenache Blanc,20
101942,"A bright, spritely single-vineyard wine with pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors that finish with a white sugar aftertaste.",83,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,14
82414,"Smooth and lightly toasty, this offers plump, palate-pleasing tree fruits and a touch of vanilla custard. Just a tad lighter than the reserve from the same vintage and vineyard.",88,US,Oregon,Chardonnay,28
76498,"Very rich and full bodied, this offers flamboyant flavors of raspberry and cherry jam. It impresses with its sheer power, and it's indisputably delicious.",88,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
78968,"This Chardonnay's lees, custard, pear and spice aromas are somewhat inharmonious. It's elegant on the palate, however, showing graceful apple flavors.",88,US,Washington,Chardonnay,19
71864,"A creamy blend of 70% Sémillon and 30% Sauvignon Blanc from a longstanding producer of dozens of wines in the Yorkville Highlands appellation in Mendocino. The wine is rich and layered, tasting of lime and crème brûlée.",88,US,California,White Blend,25
43155,"An earthy, spicy and lean wine, veering on austere, this is elegant and softly layered. Wild strawberry, mushroom and forest combine with a subtle suggestion of black tea and cinnamon to form a delicious experience that's long-lasting on the palate.",91,US,California,Pinot Noir,51
86331,"A savory wine made in a slightly sweet style that has flavors of pineapples, peaches, and vanilla oak. Acidity is all-important for balance.The blend is 92% Sauvignon Blanc and 8% Sémillon.",86,US,California,Bordeaux-style White Blend,25
87382,"Light and fruity, this smells like cucumbers, honeydew melon and green apple, tastes delicately appley and feels gentle in texture. It's light bodied, low in alcohol, fresh and thirst-quenching.",86,US,California,Pinot Grigio,17
45066,"Big and quite tannic, this is a blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot. The combination of Red Mountain fruit and the naturally tannic Petit Verdot is balanced against by the tart, juicy berry flavors and the influence from having aged in 100% new French oak. Nothing shy here, but the floral and citrusy aromatics add a welcome layer of complexity.",91,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
125164,"This rich, ripe Viognier offers upfront citrus and tropical fruit flavors that combine with vanilla honey to finish off-dry to sweet. Brisk acidity helps to provide balance.",86,US,California,Viognier,21
8729,"A little on the slender side, but this is respectable for its dry, balanced texture and pleasant blackberry and black currant flavors. It shows real elegance, too, although it's not one for the cellar, so drink up.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,35
16692,"Bone dry, firm in tannins and tartly acidic, this wine feels hard in the mouth. It shows flavors of cherries and cola, with a leathery finish. Elegant in structure, it may soften and sweeten over the next five years.",87,US,California,Syrah,35
87434,"This is quite a value for the quality, a stellar, medium-bodied, restrained wine that's high-toned and elusive at first aromatically. But it opens in the glass, delighting in blackberry, cherry and a burst of clove, showing skill in winemaking from a blend of vineyards, some valley floor and others mountain.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
20226,"Soft, rounded waves of red plum become succulent on the palate without overwhelming, despite a full-bodied style and personality. A heave of subtle tannin plays out to add body and weight as the wine develops in the glass.",90,US,California,Merlot,45
32722,"Quite a deep color for a rosé—easily confused with a light Pinot Noir—this shows blackberry, black raspberry, hibiscus and fruit punch on the nose. For such a ripe nose, the palate is quite fresh and energetic, with black-plum skins, red-apple flesh and grippy cherry-pit flavors.",88,US,California,Rosé,19
100405,"Grown on the estate in Oakville, this is a very tannic Cabernet. It's almost old-fashioned, a dark, full-bodied wine with earthy-herbal notes and a hard, astringent finish. There are complex flavors of blackberries, mocha, licorice, allspice, cloves, violets and cedar. Could do interesting things beyond 2011.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
33985,"Not from old vines, but cloned from them in the pursuit of complexity. This is a very young, backward Zin, dominated by dusty, earthy notes, like a whiff of south-facing barnboard under a hot summer sun. There are some fruity, spicy flavors, but the flavors are similarly closed, and moderate tannins and high acidity produce a scouring texture. Might be more user-friendly with a few years of aging.",85,US,California,Zinfandel,15
78279,"Baked apple and pear laced in caramel come to mind first, evoked from the aromatics of this wine. A richness of honey beckons, too. Golden in color and creamy in texture, it's balanced by streamlined acidity that keeps it elegant and refined, moving slowly toward a lengthy, drawn-out finish.",93,US,California,Chardonnay,43
62052,"Technically, the wine is too soft and hot for balance, but it's so luscious, so enjoyable, you can't help but like it. The flavors just swarm all over the palate, offering cherries, blueberries, cola, violets, leather, bacon, carob and Asian spices, and the finish is satisfyingly complex and dry.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,26
31327,"Aged 18 months in French oak, this wine is moderately aromatic, with notes of blueberry and mushroom. It's syrupy in feel yet has dry tannins.",84,US,Idaho,Sangiovese,26
88543,"This is a straightforward Cabernet that's dry, tannic and soft in acidity, making it fine to drink now. It has easy flavors of blackberries, black currants and cola.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
23948,"A decent everyday sipper. Soft and a little dull in texture, it's rich in blackberry, currant, chocolate and pecan pie flavors.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,20
56271,"A streak of sharp acidity and green mint makes this wine too tart, despite some pleasant cherry, red currant, clove and cola flavors. The wine is unlikely to develop additional bottle complexity. Sourced from the Sanford & Benedict and La Rinconada vineyards.",84,US,California,Pinot Noir,34
83484,"A clean, acidic Chardonnay, elegant and dramatic in richness. Despite ripe pineapple, pear, mango and apricot flavors, it has a steely minerality and touch of herbs that ground it. Drink now.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,44
73009,"This wine shows a classic Yakima Valley profile, with aromas and flavors of orange peel, fresh green herbs and cherry, along with barrel spice accents. It's made in a restrained style, with tart flavors carrying on the finish.",90,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,45
40759,"Burning hot in alcohol, this Zin is totally dry. It has peppery flavors of shriveled grapes and currants, with a bitter mouthfeel.",82,US,California,Zinfandel,26
56675,"This 100% varietal from one of the state's oldest vineyards brims with aromas of dark roasted coffee, char, bittersweet chocolate and black cherry. Flavors show plenty of concentration and depth with a lingering, cocoa and vanilla-filled finish.",91,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,30
86031,"A taste of charcuterie gives this Syrah a meaty, sweetish mid-palate, but it manages to finish dry, with a scour of coastal acidity. The famously pure Edna Valley fruit shows up as classic blackberries, spicy and tangy, while the tannins are significant. Give the wine until 2017–2018 to try to resolve its internal difficulties.",88,US,California,Syrah,35
92449,"Good price, but the wine is green and unripe, with that unpleasant meow odor that turns many people off.",80,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,11
16606,"Off a beat from the great '03, closer to the '02, this is an elegant young sparkler, lacking a bit in finesse. This 100% Chardonnay has slightly sweet flavors of lemon candy and yeast.",86,US,California,Sparkling Blend,35
68540,"This non-vintage blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc plays on the leafy side of the spectrum with abundant herb and green tea notes. It's tart and grainy with a compact ball of cherry and cranberry flavors that finish a touch ripe.",86,US,Washington,Red Blend,18
114776,"Intense aromas of green apple, lemon curd, lychee and lemongrass follow through to the palate alongside a hint of mango, which results in a tropical feel. Ripe and rich on the finish, it begs for a bit more acidic lift through the close.",85,US,Virginia,Vidal Blanc,17
25866,"This is a special bottling with a fancy new label that commemorates Korbel's 130th anniversary. It's slightly sweet and easy to drink, with rich, creamy flavors of honey, orange and vanilla. The blend is Chenin Blanc, French Colombard and Chardonnay.",88,US,California,Sparkling Blend,13
81505,"There's a vegetal touch in this dry, earthy Syrah. Despite some cherry and mocha flavors and a nice structure of acids and tannins, it's just not rich enough to merit a higher score.",84,US,California,Syrah,24
102422,"This 100% Syrah's berry flavors are wrapped in spice and some earthy, composty notes, further enhanced with 20% new oak, adding in licorice and espresso. The tannins are balanced but substantial, giving the wine a sense of weight and putting a firm foundation under the fruit.",88,US,Washington,Syrah,24
96763,"Too powerful in feline and gooseberry aromas and flavors, this dry, tart in-your-face Sauvignon Blanc just isn't ripe enough to recommend.",80,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
75117,"There's just a touch of oak on this Chardonnay, but it's the grapes that star. They give brisk acidity and ripe, flashy, long hangtime mango, peach, orange, Meyer lemon and honey flavors that go on and on into a lingering finish.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,15
91214,"This is a blend from Monterey and Santa Barbara counties. It's a dry, crisp, useful Pinot Noir. Fifty percent new French oak gives a smoky, charry overlay to the cherry, red currant and licorice flavors.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,29
36356,"Winemaker Michael Haddox is exploring unusual, emerging grape varieties in Washington State. This well-made Malbec is just the start, showing dried cherry fruit, graham cracker toast, and hints of stone and graphite. It's chewy and muscular, an interesting debut for the winery.",88,US,Washington,Malbec,38
59770,"This is off-dry, roughly 2% residual sugar, and it nicely balances the sugar and the acids, using the floral and spicy character of the grape to fill out the middle. It's a pretty wine, fruity with peach, melon and grapefruit.",86,US,Washington,Gewürztraminer,10
38855,"Baked black plum, gingerbread, cherry compote and nutmeg show on the rich and lavish nose of this bottling. It's a mouthful once sipped, with cooked blackberries and blueberries heavily spiced by crushed clove, and wrapped in tannins that stand up tall toward the finish.",90,US,California,Merlot,49
38956,"This reserve-level wine is sublime in stone fruit and lime as well as pear. The oak used for aging this wine was all neutral, and the taste and impact of it is unobtrusive. While vibrant in fruit, it also offers richer hints of caramel and graham cracker in complex and balanced ways, ending with persistence.",94,US,California,Chardonnay,45
92285,"Ripe lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors lend this wine a sugary tone. Fine acidity provides balance. Drink it with sweeter fare, such as ham, sausages, or melon with prosciutto.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
148230,"Rough and ready, but decent in berry-cherry fruit, with easy tannins. This is an everyday Cab with lots of good qualities.",84,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15
106694,"Big aromas of pineapple, citrus and flowers lead on this Chardonnay/Pinot Grigio blend. On the palate, lemon, ripe fruit and honey flavors are sweet and somewhat aggressive. A fun wine to pair with cheeses, dessert.",83,US,Michigan,Chardonnay-Pinot Gris,10
97864,"A slightly deeper shade of pink, this Grenache-based rosé from the new Brick Barn Vineyard by James Sparks of Liquid Farm fame offers red cherry, plum and vanilla pastry aromas. Flavors are restrained and very clean, with strawberries and cream cut by a sharp line of citrus, reminiscent of tangerine rinds.",89,US,California,Rosé,20
85259,"Muddled at first, this wine comes around to reveal a strong, floral component of rose water and geranium, staying light and fresh on the palate, subtle yet flavorful. It finishes earthy in Asian spice.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,40
1714,"Light herb aromas and vivid apple flavors make this medium-bodied wine delicious, while the tangy, nervy texture keeps the mouth tingling. It has great balance, concentration and length on the finish.",90,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
119789,"Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked. Shows a touch of bitterness in the finish, which is probably the result of its age. Still, it's a flamboyant, impressive Chardonnay, like a magnificent old tapestry that's fraying a bit around the edges.",93,US,California,Chardonnay,35
113744,"A tad earthier than other bottlings from the area, this shows damp herbs, forest-floor notes and soy on the nose, backed up by the stewed black-plum fruit. The tannins are soft but present on the palate, where teriyaki flavors mesh with elderberry, oregano and dark chocolate. This will improve with more bottle age.",88,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,46
99188,"There are very few if any Napa Cabs this good at this price. The wine is simply constructed and at its peak, but shows a drily tannic structure framing black and red currant and cedar flavors.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,18
81813,"Front-loaded with raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors, this wine's mouthfeel is soft and lush. Oak adds a nice touch of caramel.",86,US,California,Syrah-Grenache,26
77799,"Michael Mondavi's Folio Fine Wine Partners now offers an Oregon Pinot Noir, this one vinified by Rob Mondavi, a fourth- generation winemaker. Pale and elegantly styled, it shows refined winemaking skills and a European sensibility. Pungently herbal, this supple wine brings young fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry, but shows ageworthy depth and persistence. It's the sort of subtle, classic style that rewards both time and attention.",89,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,35
106851,"Pinot Noir just doesn't get richer than this. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries, with fascinatingly earthy things, like truffles and pine cones. Vibrant acidity and a hint of furry tannins give it a fine structure. This upscale Pinot Noir is drinkable now and should evolve over the next six years.",94,US,California,Pinot Noir,44
23006,"Minty, this restrained Syrah is from a sought-after vineyard, a pioneer in Sonoma County Rhône-style wines. Here, the producer keeps things interesting in swathes of white pepper, mint and cranberry, as well as a strong sense of leather throughout. High in acidity, it needs time to come together; try after 2020.",91,US,California,Syrah,38
10827,This light-bodied wine has aromas of celery and citrus that lead to crisp flavors of fresh herbs and lemon. Good acidity is smoothed out by a hint of sweetness lending a soft effect to the midpalate and finish.,85,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,8
5044,"Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family. She leaves her own mark on this structured, silky, robust and rich Cabernet, bright in red cranberry and clove. Firehouse Vineyard is on the winery estate and given to floral and herbal notes, both of which suggest themselves slowly here.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,85
25091,"This wine is serious in style, starting with a dark color, then concentrated aromas like pomegranate juice, black olive and blackberry come through. It is full bodied and moderately tannic for the kind of dense texture that's great with meat and cheese.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,12
256,"The winery's signature widely distributed white is heady in flowery jasmine, with vibrant acidity and a sense of sweetness on the palate thanks to fresh fruit flavors of grapefruit, peach and nectarine. An ideal wine for summer or whenever one needs to recall a summer's day.",88,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
100463,"Tastes just like a cherry coke, with the heat of alcohol and smoky spice of oak. That's a pleasant, even complex mélange of flavors, even though the structure is simple and direct.",85,US,California,Merlot,16
61364,"Shows the problems that California Grenache so frequently runs into, with a mushroomy, vegetal streak running right through the cherry and oak flavors. The wine is not an ager.",82,US,California,Grenache,28
49828,"The grapes come from just south of the Carneros Highway, on the Napa side. It's a big, somewhat alcoholic Pinot, rich in spicy cherries, raspberries, mocha and sandalwood. A flamboyant, luscious wine.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,65
77332,"White flowers and pine fronds perfume crisp yellow peach and apricots in this delicate, yet intensely concentrated Riesling. Zesty, cutting and spry, it's a bright star for Riesling in a region traditionally not known for the variety. Made from “virgin” seedless berries known for their intense aroma and flavor concentration.",91,US,New York,Riesling,32
43992,"Not much going on in this inexpensive wine. It's watery, with a sugary, soda pop sweet finish.",81,US,California,Chardonnay,8
15508,"This is a very late release for this 2007 Merlot, and the wine is well on its way to full maturity. Smooth and supple, its fruit is drying out, showing cherry-flavored fruit leather as the main component. Streaks of coffee and tobacco fill in the finish.",88,US,Washington,Merlot,30
103792,"Hints of cedar and spice accent ripe red-fruit and flower notes on this distinctly Old World-style Pinot Noir. A fresh green-herb flavor, brisk acidity and penetrating tannins drive through the long finish.",88,US,New York,Pinot Noir,20
132606,"A bit soft and jammy, with somewhat simple flavors of raspberries, cherries and even white chocolate. But those flavors are delicious. Makes you wonder if some of these Dijon clones are better for blending, instead of bottling on their own.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,48
97357,"Showing the rustic tannins and peppery spices that Dry Creek Cabs usually possess, this Cab wants a little time in the cellar. With black currant, chocolate, tobacco and herb flavors, it's very close in quality to the winery's regular '05 Cab, with a little more concentration and a firmer tannin structure.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,50
118712,"Very rich, extracted and soft in tannins and acids, a melt-in-your-mouth Zin with almost sweet flavors of milk chocolate, crushed ripe cherries, licorice, caramelized wood and oodles of black pepper. Should develop over the next 4–6 years.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,40
56874,"The sugary sweetness of this wine exaggerates the tannins, making them taste more raw and angular than they really are. Flavor-wise, it's all about cherry and blackberry jam.",82,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,38
70871,"Dark and sappy, with earth-driven complexity, this includes as many as 15 different clones planted on the far western edge of the AVA. Savory flavors bring black cherry, cola, smoke, and an underpinning of earth and black tea.",92,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,62
44049,"A rich, oaky wine easily as good as Chards that cost far more, it has aromas and flavors of ripe white peaches and Delicious apples, and scads of oriental spice. Avoids excessive sweetness, although oak tannins and glycerin make it round and soft. —S.H.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,16
47718,"Distinctly Sonoma Coast in the forest berry fruits and feral, earthy notes of anise, balsam and Dr. Pepper cola. Fine and silky in the mouth, with modest alcohol and a burst of cool-climate acidity. A more feminine style of Pinot, which is not to understate its power. Could easily develop over the next six years, but it's pretty compelling now.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,35
22196,"This opens with a strong scent of herb and bud; it's sharp and aggressively leafy. The wine follows with similar flavors. The light fruit flavors of plum and berry are quickly suffocated with leaf, herb, earth, spice and tannin. Time may be the answer.",85,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,30
26821,"A beautiful 100% Cabernet that comes from Rutherford and St. Helena. It's soft and dry and ultrarich, with blackberry, cherry, licorice, cola, spice and smoky new oak flavors. Seems best now and through 2014.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,65
105497,"Warming spice, cherry and plum on the nose and palate give this wine a food-friendly edge. A touch of smoke and mocha adds appeal. Pair with grilled meats, pastas.",84,US,New York,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,15
79619,"Too sweet, basically off-dry in sugary orange, lime and kiwi flavors. Bracing acidity helps provide balance, but it needs to be drier.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,20
50603,"Tart and jammy, with acidic, one-dimensional flavors of pineapples, vanilla and butterscotch.",83,US,California,Chardonnay,20
108504,"A beautiful, soft and likeable Pinot Noir, with considerable complexity. Shows waves of black cherries, red currants, cola, mocha, bacon, licorice and sandalwood flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices. Dry and silky, this Pinot is drinking well now, and should hold over the next six years.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,60
68459,"This is the richest and most balanced of the winery's new red wines. It's dry and soft, with pleasurable flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries and dried herbs, wrapped into furry tannins. Ready now.",86,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,38
28803,"Powerfully brambly this gigantic wine hails from a monumental vineyard that consistently delivers fine-tuned tension between structure and intensity. Sizable tannins surround a soft mouthfeel of plum, leather and black pepper, the concentration suggesting aging through 2020.",88,US,California,Zinfandel,50
26561,"Tough in tannins and bone dry, this Merlot's raisin and blackberry fruit simply isn't strong enough to stand up to the astringency.",83,US,California,Merlot,20
57727,"A very nice wine, and more proof, if it's needed, that PG can make a crisp, interesting dry white even at an everyday price. Acidity is high and clean, giving a vibrancy to the citrus, honeysuckle, mineral and vanilla flavors.",86,US,California,Pinot Grigio,10
118004,"This 50-50 blend from two well-established vineyards is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Young and stiff and still quite tannic, it shows compact cassis and blackberry fruit with an earthy underpinning, a hint of stem that adds some bite to the tannins. As time smoothes it and softens the tannins, more of the concentrated fruit should emerge; it's well-made and balanced; a fine example of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon done in a classic Bordeaux style.",89,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,40
15336,"Similar to Pinot Noir in the light, silky texture, easy tannins and cherry flavors. A good, dry wine, but rustic, and a little unbalanced in ripeness levels.",85,US,California,Tempranillo,40
16106,"Sleek, smooth and elegant, with fine tannins that frame a wine that's flush with plum, cassis, anise, herb and chocolate flavors. Plush and velvety on the palate, it's got a finish that doesn't quit. Cabernet doesn't get much better, anytime or anywhere.",96,US,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90
83960,"This fine wine straddles the border between good and complex. The elements are terrific: pedigreed blackberry and cassis fruit, fine oak nuances, and soft Sonoma tannins. It's just a tad thin in the middle. Drink it with meat.",87,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,25
53347,"Too sugary sweet, this Cab tastes like the cherry and blackberry filling inside a baked fruit tart. Make it drier and it would be great.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,30
60796,"At the age of 2 1/2 years or so, this fresh Syrah is all about licorice, currant and blackberry fruit, with loads of black pepper. Tastes like it's right out of the fermenter, with firm tannins and bright acidity. Doesn't drink like an ager, so give it a good decant and drink soon.",88,US,California,Syrah,30
118253,"Lots of zippy acidity in this dry, jammy Zin. It may be too sharp for some people, despite the cherry fruit, beef jerky and spice flavors.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,10
538,"This is sourced from 30-year-old Wädenswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA. It's complex and compelling, showing layers of stone, strawberry, citrus, chocolate and sassafras. It's an elegant wine, well proportioned and modest in scope, but delicious.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,45
11254,"This pure varietal seems underripe, with scents of mushrooms and tar, and no fruit in sight. The finish turns bitter, with dry tannins.",83,US,Oregon,Merlot,28
88994,"Intensely earthy, this wine hails predominantly from Susanna's Vineyard, a site in the heart of the Green Valley section of the larger Russian River Valley that's known for its elevation and coolness. Here, crisp raspberry and cherry do provide a sense of that coolness, but the wine develops into a substantial behemoth of full-bodied richness and weight, with a powerful, peppery finish.",90,US,California,Pinot Noir,59
102780,"Strongly minty with a streak of wintergreen, this barrel selection comes from the right AVA for Oregon Tempranillo, but does not fully capture the varietal flavors. It's an earthy, tart, generic red wine, with drying tannins and a short finish.",86,US,Oregon,Tempranillo,25
36554,"Muted, broad orchard fruit and lemon flavors are etched with acids that become more lifted on the finish. An easy-drinking wine to pair with mild white fish, like tilapia.",84,US,Virginia,Chardonnay,20
90842,"Dry and acidic, this 100% Cabernet isn't offering much now. It's strong in tannins and modest in blackberry fruit. Feels austere and hot, with 15.7% alcohol, and its future is far from assured.",85,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,48
73482,"Few Pinots are this forward and rich in raspberry and cherry jam and softened cola flavors. It's instantly luscious, but soft, and lacking the balance for aging. Drink up.",86,US,California,Pinot Noir,52
85188,"Succulent in red cherry and cassis, this wine has a surprising level of depth and grip. It finds its way with integrated tannins, soft layers of caramelized oak and a brightness of fruit and acidity.",90,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,38
19799,"A wine with bright, red and blue fruit notes that's full and structured, laced with pepper that gets better the longer you let it open up. The finish is long and has traces of sweet caramel and vanilla.",87,US,California,Syrah,28
48887,"All estate, a blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cab Franc, 14% Merlot, and 14% Petit Verdot. This is tilted toward a French Bordeaux style, with an earthy, woody character integrated into the wine. The fruit is well defined, tight and compact cassis and cherry, with the chocolaty streak that characterizes the Va Piano vineyard. Very young, very tight, with good aging potential.",91,US,Washington,Red Blend,48
138715,"You can smell the minerals in this tight, compelling wine. It has an aroma suggesting cold metal, even a touch of diesel, floating above the guava, pineapple, nectarine and peach flavors. Smoky oak and zesty acidity help make this Chard very complex and satisfying.",91,US,California,Chardonnay,35
122771,"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that.",97,US,California,Pinot Noir,78
53504,"This is 100% new oak (primarily Taransaud, 32 months), and it's a marvelous example of the grape, the vineyard and the strengths of Washington fruit. The Shafer Hillside Select is the inspiration for the extended barrel aging and the focus on round, sweet tannins. This is a tight wine, with a lovely purity of fruit that captures the cassis, the black cherry, the subtle herbal character of the Cabernet grape. This is from the oldest block in the vineyard—now eight -year-old vines.",92,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,60
102297,"This blend of Cabernet Franc (52%) along with Syrah (38%), Cabernet Sauvignon (8%) and 2% Merlot saw just a smidgeon (10%) of new oak. Notes of dried herbs, raspberries and dark chocolate partner with lithe fruit flavors backed by grainy tannins.",88,US,Washington,Red Blend,12
44347,"Easily the best Merlot in memory from Lake County, this one stands next to anything from Napa Valley, which is just over the hill from the vineyard. Shows a gorgeous tannin structure, with ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, mocha, green olives and cedar.",93,US,California,Merlot,40
43523,"This is a slightly grassy, green white wine that fans of this style may enjoy; others not so much. Light in alcohol, it has medium body and crispness.",84,US,California,Sauvignon Blanc,18
112226,"Fresh peach and light floral aromas lead to ripe, grapey flavors and a soft, soothing texture in this medium-bodied wine. It is smooth and low in acid, with a charming flowery element that helps it stand out.",85,US,California,Chardonnay,15
33671,"Barrel flavors of toast and chocolate cover light strawberry fruit. It's pleasant enough, but the flavors have not yet jelled. Give it until 2016 to age.",86,US,Washington,Merlot,25
49645,"Clear, bright and fragrant, with a soft and seductive nose. This is a wine that can only be called pretty, with a light floral component to it—roses maybe. There’s lots of ripe black-cherry fruit, some raspberries, and a chocolaty edge. It’s made for drinking right away, but structured enough for near-term aging.",88,US,Washington,Merlot,25
140532,"Simple and rustic, this Zin has high alcohol, which may account for the hotly sweet mouthfeel that tastes and feels like cherries and blackberries dripped in chili-pepper sauce. It'll be fine with barbecued chicken and ribs.",84,US,California,Zinfandel,20
64355,"Luxuriously honeyed, this wine sings in rich hazelnut but also remains crisp on the palate, relatively light-bodied in fresh pear and lemon. Staying lithe as it goes down, it has subtle power and integrated oak, finishing creamy and bold.",90,US,California,Chardonnay,40
122743,"A very good Cab, dry, full-bodied and fruity. The tannins are thick and hard, making it difficult to savor the underlying blackberries, black cherries, blueberries and dark chocolate. If you drink it now, decant. Otherwise, try over the next 4–6 years.",92,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,39
102944,"This year's blend of 53% Mourvèdre, 18% Counoise, 17% Grenache and 12% Cinsault shows squeezed elderberries, black raspberries, dried rose petals, potpourri, dried sagebrush and wet slate on the nose. The palate pops with more raspberries, pomegranate, dried fennel, white pepper and a touch of cooked lamb.",91,US,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,25
50241,"This is a tip-top appellation blend from a winery based in the Lompoc Wine Ghetto, showing fresh-pressed raspberries, fennel pollen, dried rose petals and hibiscus on the nose. It's tightly wound on the spicy palate, with light cranberry, thyme, marjoram and Earl Grey tea flavors.",93,US,California,Pinot Noir,38
24121,"It's a shame that so little of this wine is made, as it is a textbook example of a powerful, beautifully balanced Syrah from this tiny AVA in the heart of the Yakima Valley. Black fruits abound, wrapped in a firm, muscular, polished package by fine-grained tannins and a dark chocolate finish.",92,US,Washington,Syrah,28
34384,"This Syrah is aged for 21 months in 100% French oak—half of which was new. Spring Valley Vineyard has had a dramatic expansion, which has allowed it to increase production without damaging quality. Soft and smooth, this offers a pretty raspberry flavor that's lightly peppery, with a hint of sweet grain and a side note of orange peel that rides on the tip of the tongue. It's a pleasure to drink already, although it can be cellared for another 6–8 years.",90,US,Washington,Syrah,50
121533,"Grenache is not an easy grape to ripen in Washington, but this is just about perfect—juicy with fresh berry and rhubarb fruit, and added notes of marjoram, rosemary and cracked pepper. Full-bodied and pushing close to 15% alcohol, this is fine pizza wine.",89,US,Washington,Grenache,28
34921,"The flagship wine from Quilceda Creek offers exotic scents of plum, cassis, loam, coffee and pine sap, a rich and evocative blend. The wine delivers all that is promised and more; it is deep and dense with flavor, polished, focused and persistent. Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits.",99,US,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,125
24402,"Cabernet Franc is a difficult variety to make by itself in California, which is why so few wineries do. Reverie gives it a good try. Their '09 is quite tasty in cherries, minerals and oak, with distinguished mountain tannins and a savory, spicy finish. But it's not one for the cellar, so drink before 2014.",90,US,California,Cabernet Franc,64
28001,"This is a soft, simple white marked by green olive and vanilla bean flavors that feel concentrated and full on the finish.",86,US,California,Chardonnay,25
99863,"A beautiful Merlot, Wente's best in at least a decade. It's not one of those big, superripe Napa Merlots, but instead is elegant and classically balanced, almost Bordeaux in style, with rich tannins and good acidity. There's an herbal touch to the black cherry and mineral flavors. Very fine, very appealing, and a natural companion for food. Now–2012.",92,US,California,Merlot,35
46205,"Sangiovese doesn't do well in California as a dry table wine but it makes a pretty good rosé. The grape's naturally high acidity frames its classic cherry flavors, which are deliciously clean and pure in this steel-fermented wine. Best of all, the wine is relatively low in alcohol and dry. Try this polished rosé with sushi.",88,US,California,Sangiovese,14
59166,"The scent of apple blossoms perfume this round, richly structured wine, accentuating flavors of apple and pear on the palate. Touches of vanilla and cream add weight and mouthfeel, but the wine finishes crisp with lemony acidity and saline minerality.",87,US,New York,Chardonnay,18
113138,"As sweet as a brown-sugared power bar, with cherry, roasted almond, crunchy granola, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. Delicious and easy. Drink right away.",87,US,California,Pinot Noir,26
64010,"Dark, bone dry, and acidic, although not particularly tannic, with bitter cherry and blackberry flavors.",84,US,California,Teroldego,30
28937,"This 100% Pinot Noir is full-bodied and rich, with raspberry, cherry, yeast, toast and vanilla flavors that finish sweet and honeyed. The mouthfeel is soft and silky. Lovely for drinking now, as a toast or just Sunday brunch.",89,US,California,Sparkling Blend,30
99580,"This dessert wine is very sweet but not incredibly so, with a flavor like apricot and tangerine jam, drizzled with honey and vanilla extract and sprinkled with cinnamon. If that sounds delicious, it is, and the acidity makes it clean and zesty. The price isn't bad, considering that this is a full bottle, not a half bottle as so many dessert wines are.",91,US,California,Muscat Canelli,38
13325,"An assertive oak influence gives this full-bodied wine a cedar and pencil shavings aroma. On the palate ripe black cherry flavors mingle with more spicy, perfumed oak elements. It's quite tannic, but the ripe fruit and oak seem to balance out the astringency in a way that will make it a great match with rich, meaty dishes.",90,US,California,Petit Verdot,54
6579,"Made from 100% Cab, this wine pours inky black, and feels softly ripe in the mouth, with pie-filling blackberries, cherries, mocha, plums, tobacco and sweet dusty spices. Shows a tannic astringency that strongly suggests cellaring, although it's flashy now. Best after 2011 and beyond.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,75
96874,"Pretty good southern Rhône-style red blend, with rich cherry-berry, chocolate, spice and sandalwood flavors that finish dry and robust. Needs a juicy burger to cut through the tannins. Ready now.",85,US,California,Grenache-Syrah,25
129549,"Minty cedar rides atop an expansive succulence in this estate wine that impresses in its ability to support grippy tannin and generous fruit. Blackberry and coffee highlight the flavor spectrum, reaching dark, brooding length on the finish.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,135
83378,"The estate vineyard is on the east side of Rutherford, on Howell Mountain Road, up into the Vaca Mountains. This is prime Cabernet territory, and the wine is 100% varietal. It's very rich and dry in blackberries, with a firmly tannic astringency and a fine coating of oak. Needs time to come around. Give it at least six years, possibly far longer.",94,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,105
121010,"From a tiny spot near the town of Forestville, this vineyard-designate does justice to the special site, planted in Goldridge dirt to a variety of suitcase clones. Earth, sage and a persistence of exotic spice mark it first, inviting one in for further exploration of raspberry, cherry and a firmness of tannin. Concentrated, it's enjoyable now and yet should have years more to go in the bottle. Drink now through 2024.",94,US,California,Pinot Noir,69
32817,"This Southern Rhône-style blend of Mourvèdre, Grenache and Cinsault opens with a lovely nose of violet and blue fruit scents. The fruit flavors are joined by a layer of wet stone, which adds some heft to the wine's foundation. Sleek and tangy, this can be consumed young, or it can be aged for several more years.",90,US,Washington,Rhône-style Red Blend,32
62563,"Ripe orange and papaya, spice, graham cracker and smoke are a few of the adjectives tasters used to describe the nose of this delightful wine. Though rich and open on the palate, it never gets loose or sloppy. A great chalk element and spice accents nicely offset the rich fruit foundation. Buttered toast and nutty, leesy notes mingle with pineapple on the long, finely balanced back end.",92,US,California,Chardonnay,45
18982,"The fruit from this well-located vineyard shines in this new vintage. Cherries and berries are set in a composty, moist, loamy framework. Hints of barnyard are subtle enough to add texture and depth. Lovely complexity.",91,US,Oregon,Pinot Noir,40
33012,"From a particular block with limestone soils, this is indeed a light, steely and minerally white wine, given nine months in French oak, only 17% of it new. It takes on that oak with subtle concentration, offering a touch of baked pineapple, peach and vanilla, ending in a bittersweet bite of Meyer lemon.",88,US,California,Chardonnay,45
8219,"Give this wine 3–5 years in the cellar to let the parts come together. Right now, it's an unconnected mélange of sweet cherry pie, mocha, licorice, toasty oak and dusty tannins. By 2016 it should start to find its harmonious sweet spot.",92,US,California,Merlot,55
46491,"Coconut macaroon and smoky leather stand out most in this burly, bombastic and beyond full-bodied wine, which drinks ripe and hot.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,36
117464,"This is one of the better wines emerging from Southern California, specifically San Diego County, where vintners should bet on Italian varieties. Pretty and fresh aromas of rose petals, crushed pomegranate, allspice, hibiscus, sandalwood and light licorice lead into a palate full of cedar-laced raspberry flavors, rounded by hints of molasses and chai.",91,US,California,Montepulciano,38
114769,"The bouquet of Farrell's wine is a mixed bag of buttered popcorn, minerals, herbs, citrus fruit, pineapple and melon stuffed in an oak envelope. Similarly attractive flavors mark the palate, which is fairly full and has an almost rustic quality. Has all the body and length you could want, if not quite all the balance and finesse.",87,US,California,Chardonnay,34
72495,"A textbook example of Washington Sauvignon Blanc, this is bright, racy, juicy and vibrant, with an array of crisp, clean fruit flavors. Citrus, grapefruit and pear are all in the mix, accented with notes of sweet grain from aging in new oak.",90,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,19
90047,"Aiming to highlight one Cab clone grown in the dusty soils of the appellation, this well-crafted wine remains tight in grippy tannins for the meantime. Just enough compelling notes of cedar, grenadine, red cherry and truffle hit the palate to suggest further aging. Drink from 2017–2027.",93,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,145
100311,This terrific wine has vibrant fruit flavors and feelings of focus and energy on the palate. Firm acidity and fine-grained tannins add structure and lend support to the spicy oak and ripe cherry and blackberry nuances that start in the aromas and carry through the taste and finish.,91,US,California,Zinfandel,18
144128,"Made with 82% Cabernet, this interesting wine is showing all kinds of possibilities. It's a good red now, sturdily dry and tannic, with red cherry, pomegranate, sweet tobacco and allspice flavors. But it's a little juvenile. I would decant it as long as possible, and it should enjoy a cellar life of up to 10 years.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,85
69712,"Here's a big, sumptuous, fat, oily Chardonnay, massive in tropical fruits, spices, minerals and smoky buttered toast. The creamy texture makes it feel especially rich. Aged in 57% new oak, it's truly a decadent—but balanced—Chardonnay.",93,US,California,Chardonnay,30
51708,"Pleasantly spicy and round, this pure Sauvignon Blanc has light lemon and orange peel flavors, and a lively core which leaves a finishing impression of buttery, fresh-baked brioche. Not especially deep, but appealing.",88,US,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,18
134634,"Sausal's old vines are about 50 years old, which may account for the unusual concentration and balance of this wine. It floods the mouth with blackberry, spice and mocha flavors, yet is dry and balanced and not at all hot. Drink now.",86,US,California,Zinfandel,18
115063,"A 100% varietal wine, this Cab is subtle and elegant in crisp red fruit, bordering on a richness that remains at the cusp of the palate. Leather and tobacco leaf figure into the mix as well, along a well-integrated foundation of oak and tannin, finishing with a hint of brick.",91,US,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,49
1708,"Aromatic layers of golden apple and pear, beeswax and toasty brioche lead to an ample, concentrated palate, which comes threaded with glowing acids.",88,US,Arizona,Chenin Blanc,28
44154,"Sourced from a small block of Syrah at the estate vineyard of Leonetti Cellar, this is the top wine from Waters. Though the fruit is still young, it already shows strength, clarity and persistence. Vanilla cracker, sweet caramel, rich strawberry and white pepper mingle seamlessly. And the best is yet to come.",91,US,Washington,Syrah,40
